natural environments has been rigorously field tested. For this purpose, three
test sites differing sharply in climatology, geology, and pedology were
selected in topographically diverse California.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>The first location, the 12000 ft level of White
Mountain (fig. 1), afforded a cold, rocky slope well above timberline in
rarified atmosphere. Several minutes after the test began, at twilight, in
subfreezing weather, a snowfall engulfed the area. In a futile effort to avoid
being snowbound, the field party discontinued the test after a total elapsed
period of only 50 minutes. However, this was sufficient time for the
microorganisms gathered into the test unit to produce significantly more C<sup>14</sup>O<sub>2
</sub>from the labeled medium than did the antimetabolite inhibited organisms
in the control unit.</p>

components except the electronics were heat sterilized. The second field test
was made on a sand dune in Death Valley (fig. 2). The sparsity of organic
material in the soil and the hot, dry environment led to the selection of this
site. Although the test was monitored for 24 hours the first hour was
sufficient to determine the presence of microorganisms on the sand.</p>

flats which provided a hot, dry, and highly saline environment (fig. 3).
Salinity was particularly desired since some astronomers have speculated that
the surface of Mars may be rich in salts. Again, the experiment produced
positive evidence for the presence of microorganisms within one hour. The test
was continued for 24 hours. Fig. 4 presents the results of the first five
hours. They are typical of the data obtained at White Mountain and Death
Valley. An unfavorable bias injected into the Salton Sea desert flat test is
worth noting. The test and control Gulliver units fired two lines each. In the
retrieval process, one line snagged on a rock and was broken. The unit thus
supplied with sample by only one line was deliberately selected as the test
instrument and the antimetabolite was subsequently fired into the other one.
Despite the loss of sample, the test unit showed significantly higher metabolic
activity than the control very shortly after the antimetabolite was injected
into the latter.</p>

hard clay soil containing approximately 15% iron oxides, rich in limonite.
While the overall environment was not as extreme as at the California test
sites, the hard soil challenged the sampling system and the iron content was of
interest because of the speculation concerning the concentrated presence of
iron oxides, possibly limonite, on Mars. Response in this test was positive and
rapid as in the other three.</p>

experiments were performed which might significantly affect the design of
Gulliver. One or two drops of the labeled media (M5 and M9) were directly
applied to soil and rock. Planchets containing paper pads moistened with barium
hydroxide solution were inverted over the spots of media and permitted to
collect the C<sup>14</sup>O<sub>2</sub> evolved for 30 minutes to one hour.
Results were one or two orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the
automated field instruments in a similar period. For example, one planchet
inverted over two drops of M9 medium applied directly to the Death Valley sand
dune collected sufficient <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> within one hour to yield
40000 c/min. Differences in counting device sensitivity, geometry of
presentation and self-absorption between the two systems are not sufficient to
account for the increased activity obtained in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

occurs in the process of sampling, apparently has an adverse effect on
metabolic activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>For some time, this laboratory has been developing a
second life detection system called Diogenes [2]. The method is based on the
firefly bioluminescent reaction [3, 4, 5]<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>
</i>and the ubiquity of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) in terrestrial life. The
light producing steps of the reaction are:</p>

with all the ingredients except ATP, thereby becoming a specific, quantitative
assay for ATP. No other energy-rich phosphate compound, or any other material,
is known to produce a positive response. The peak amplitude of emitted light is
obtained within 0.5 sec and can be used as a quantitative index for ATP, if the
reactions are conducted under constant conditions. The method is as sensitive
as it is rapid. Using commercially available photomultiplier tubes, amplifiers
and recorders, as little as 10<sup>-7</sup> &#947; of ATP has been detected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Two instruments have been assembled in this
laboratory. Each has a specially designed reaction-presentation chamber in
which a cuvette, containing all the reactants except ATP, can be positioned to
confront the photodetector in a light-tight box. ATP, or material suspected of
containing ATP, is injected into the cuvette via syringe through a light-tight
rubber plug in the reaction-presentation chamber. One of the instrument systems
traces the intensity of emitted light on a strip chart recorder; the second
system uses an oscilloscope to trace the emf produced by the signal from the
photodetector tube. A recording of the event is made by photographing the
sweep. Fig. 5 shows the standard response obtained with 5 x 10<sup>-4</sup> &#947;
of pure ATP. The response produced by one thousand yeast cells is shown in fig.
6. Fig. 7 shows the trace generated by the injection of 250000 <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Serratia marcescens </i>cells into the
reaction mixture. As few as 6000 <i>S. </i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>marcescens
</i>cells have been detected. To maximize responses, cellular ATP is liberated
by ultrasonic vibration or by chemical extraction. The almost vertical rise of
the trace corresponds to the moment of injection of the ATP or cellular
material. Fig. 8 shows the trace obtained when sterile, distilled water was
injected as a control. In this instance, the low level of inherent light,
found to be present in the ATP-free reaction mixture, is shown to be somewhat
reduced as the result of dilution by the introduction of the water.</p>

method might next be developed as an extraterrestrial life detection probe for
a lander or in-flight mission. In a non-survivable capsule, the ATP experiment
could provide a biological sensor for an instrument package otherwise limited
to making physical determinations. The fact that the abiogenic synthesis of ATP
by rather simple procedures has been reported [6] adds a note of caution to
conclusions which might be drawn from the experiment since any ATP detected in
this fashion might be of non-biologic origin. However, merely the presence of
this important compound would have considerable biological significance. As a
minimum it would establish the fact that a rather complex life precursor was
available to any system that might be operating in the genesis of living
material. In a surviving life detection capsule, this limitation on
interpretation might be removed by sequential ATP analyses demonstrating growth
or metabolism. The use of an antimetabolite, as in the case of Gulliver, would
aid interpretation. Uncoupling agents to prevent phosphorylation might also be
used. In an experiment continuing for several hours, a distinction between
abiogenic ATP and ATP operating in a living system might be made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>In several aspects, Gulliver and Diogenes are
complementary and make good companion experiments. In all of known biology, the
production of CO<sub>2</sub>, or any other metabolic transformation, requires
the direct or indirect mediation of ATP as an energy transfer mechanism. Thus
the CO<sub>2 </sub>sought by Gulliver and the ATP sought by Diogenes are
interlocking parameters in basic metabolic systems such as the Krebs cycle or
the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. If life detected were similar to that on Earth,
combining these two experiments would provide the redundancy desired in space
experiments. If the life encountered were only partially similar to our own,
the dual approach would increase the probability of a successful experiment.
Another complementary aspect is that Gulliver provides for continuous,
cumulative, non-destructive monitoring while Diogenes would render discrete
determinations through destructive analysis. In this way, Gulliver provides
continuity which Diogenes could complement with a series of independent
observations. There is another, most important complementary aspect of the two
experiments. An experiment seeking to detect the production of CO<sub>2</sub>
from simple precursors is fairly general, or broad. Even if extraterrestrial
life is quite dissimilar from terrestrial life, it is conceivable that it would
respond to Gulliver. The tri-atomic structure and molecular weight of 44
characterize CO<sub>2 </sub>as a fairly simple compound. ATP, on the other
hand, merely from the point of view of its 47 atoms and molecular weight of
507, is an order of magnitude more complex. Thus, in a life system evolved
independently from our own, and about which we have no prior knowledge, CO<sub>2</sub>
is more likely than ATP to fulfill a metabolic role.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>A life or life-precursor system develops by
incorporating functional compounds. The probability for the incorporation of a
specific simple compound is much larger than that for a specific complex
compound because of the greater variations in which the elements of the latter
can be combined. For example, it is possible that, if an alien life requires
the use of a nucleotide to take advantage of energy-rich phosphate bonding, it
might utilize other phosphorylated derivatives than those of adenine. By
comparison, the chance of substituting an analogue for CO<sub>2 </sub>in the
course of random evolution is severely limited. Accordingly, a positive
response from Diogenes would indicate a biochemistry necessarily more similar
to that on Earth than would a positive response from Gulliver alone.</p>

system must replicate, mutate, and incorporate the mutation into its progeny to
be defined as living, it is unlikely that early exobiological experiments will
completely satisfy these criteria. Initial experiments would be considered
quite successful if they could find and identify complex organic molecules
associated with life on Earth, detect material having characteristics of
familiar life-associated materials, or monitor metabolism and growth. Of these
indices, the observation of metabolism and growth provides the strongest
evidence. They can best be monitored by observing: a) the uptake of raw
materials into the system or associated increase in mass, preferably at an
exponential rate; b) the transformation of these materials into one or more known
or supposed life components within the system; (c) the elimination of end
products from the system. A control must be incorporated into the experiment to
determine whether the observed process is characteristic of life or is a simple
chemical reaction. Possible approaches to the control problem include: a) the
use of selected antimetabolites which would not be expected to interfere with
the simple chemical reaction; b) a determination of whether the reaction
follows the Q<sub>10 </sub>law in accordance with simple chemistry or whether
an inhibition occurs at some temperature thus providing an analogy with the
denaturation of protein; (c) a means for demonstrating that the process acts in
the direction of decreased entropy.</p>

none;text-autospace:none'>In this context, fig. 9 was devised to provide a
logical approach to the design of exobiological experiments. It presents the
complexity and probability of evolutionary incorporation of specific compounds
in the groups indicated. The elements and compounds have been grouped into
classes according to relative complexity. For convenience, complexity has
been defined as the number of atoms in the compounds. Obviously, complexity of
a compound is determined by more than the number of its constituent atoms. The
intricacy of the structure should be taken into consideration. Such
consideration would always tend to increase the complexity over that assigned
to an amorphous mass of atoms. On the other hand, the atoms in compounds can
neither be amorphous nor assume all geometrically possible positions. To facilitate
this gross approximation, comparisons of complexity have been reduced to
approximate orders of magnitude as indicated in the figure. A breakdown of
specific types of compounds falling into each of the classifications is
presented in table 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

approximate orders of magnitude for the probability that specific compounds
would be incorporated into an unknown living system. No attempt will be made at
this time to assign numbers or to indicate that the shape of the curve implies
anything beyond the fact that it is an exaggerated reflection of the complexity
curve. That is, the probability that a given compound will have been
incorporated into a developing life system is considerably less than the inverse
of its complexity. This becomes apparent if one considers the tremendous number
of precise events which must precede the development of a macromolecule. Any of
the almost infinite number of variations that might have been incorporated into
the developmental process would have produced a different macromolecule than
the specific one in question. This variant may have been just as complex and
probable as the original macromolecule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>As shown in fig. 9, the life process takes relatively
few elements and shapes and forms them through intricate metabolic pathways
into a vast array of complex compounds. These, in turn, are used for continuing
and extending the process. Through degradation, or byproduct production, the
elements leave the living system in relatively simple compounds, or as
elements. It is likely that the utilization of elements and simple compounds in
any living system would be cyclical as it is on Earth. Otherwise, the depletion
of available starting materials and accumulation of end products would cause
the life process to cease in a relatively short course of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>No qualifying analogy with Earth life is required in
stating that it is highly probable that elements and simple compounds will be
incorporated into any living system. Roughly the same high degree of
probability can be applied to the production of simple end products of the
system. As more complex compounds are sought, the living mechanism itself must
be entered. Therefore, the probability of finding specific compounds in an alien
organism decreases severely. The difficulty in establishing the presence of
life through the detection of macromolecules is alleviated somewhat if the
sensor mechanism can detect entire groups, such as proteins or nucleic acids,
rather than a specific compound. This approach, however, cannot substantially
increase the probability of detecting macromolecules in extraterrestrial life
because the only models we have are Earth models produced from a single
evolutionary line. Even if the biochemistry of the target planet were similar
to that of the Earth, in an independent evolution the precise structure of
these complicated compounds would probably differ from their Earth counterparts
although the same functions were fulfilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Experiments which should be utilized in the early
phase of extraterrestrial exploration should be those with the highest
probability of determining the existence of life. These would be the
experiments seeking to observe the participation of elements and simple
compounds in metabolic activity. While attendant upon, and essential to, the
life process, these materials can be observed without penetrating the complex
labyrinth of the living mechanism. Since these experiments are centered outside
of the black box of the living unit, relatively little can be gleaned from
them concerning the biochemical details of any life detected. To examine this
problem more carefully for a possible relationship with terrestrial life, the
complexity curve of fig. 9 must be ascended and, correspondingly, the
probability for success decreases. To ascertain that any alien life was closely
related to Earth biochemistry, the life detection envelope would have to be
fully explored with appropriate experiments including those for the nucleic
acids. Although early exobiology capsules should be weighted strongly toward
the simple compound experiments, once the existence of life has been
established subsequent experiments should progress in the direction of the
macromolecules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>So far, the discussion has been limited to the
probability of specific compounds having been <i>incorporated </i>into a living
system about which there is no <i>a priori</i> knowledge. The probability of <i>detecting</i>
a specific compound may be considerably modified by percent abundance and
distribution of the compound. For example, a highly improbable metabolic
material may have been selected by the evolutionary process and produced in
greater abundance than a simpler metabolic compound. This would result in a
higher probability of finding the complex compound than the simple one.
However, the probabilities concerning abundance and distribution are equal for
all compounds selected by an alien living process. But the problem of chemical
identification is more difficult for the complex compounds, a fact made very clear
by the history of terrestrial chemistry and biochemistry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>The life detection envelope offers a spectrum of
experiments. Those suggested by the complex compounds in the center of the
curve are antithetical to those suggested at either end of the curve.
Nonetheless, they are complementary. An alien life can best be detected through
experiments observing the simple precursor or end products. However,
elucidation of the life mechanism will depend upon observation of the
participation of complex compounds in the living process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Gulliver is an example of an experiment concerned
with certain beginning and end products involved in the life process. These
products are simple gases, the formation of which is not dependent upon a
single metabolic pathway, but can be produced through many interacting and
interrelated pathways. Diogenes, on the other hand, seeks ATP or metabolic
involvement of ATP, a compound beginning the steep ascent on the complexity
curve. While not diametrically opposed, as CO<sub>2 </sub>and DNA experiments
would be, Gulliver and Diogenes are conceptual antitheses. A complete
exobiology program will ultimately require complementary data from general and
specific systems. It will also require proof of function as a part of the
experiment since the mere detection of a compound is not sufficient to prove
the existence of life.</p>
