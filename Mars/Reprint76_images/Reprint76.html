different types of biological experiments on samples of martian surface
material (“soil”) were conducted inside the Viking lander. In the carbon
assimilation or pyrolytic release experiment, <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2 </sub>and <sup>14</sup>CO
were exposed to soil in the presence of light. A small amount of gas was found
to be converted into organic material. Heat treatment of a duplicate sample
prevented such conversion. In the gas exchange experiment, soil was first
humidified (exposed to water vapor) for 6 sols and then wet with a complex
aqueous solution of metabolites. The gas above the soil was monitored by gas
chromatography. A substantial amount of O<sub>2</sub> was detected in the first
chromatogram taken 2.8 hours after humidification. Subsequent analyses revealed
that significant increases in CO<sub>2 </sub>and only small changes in N<sub>2 </sub>had
also occurred. In the labeled release experiment, soil was moistened with a
solution containing several <sup>14</sup>C-labeled organic compounds. A
substantial evolution of radioactive gas was registered. but did not occur with
a duplicate heat-treated sample. Alternative chemical and biological
interpretations are possible for these preliminary data. The experiments are
still in process, and these results so far do not allow a decision regarding
the existence of life on the planet Mars.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

present here a preliminary progress report on the Viking biological
investigation, through its first month. Details of the scientific concepts
behind each of the experiments, as well as examples of the kinds of results
that are obtained when these concepts are tested with the use of terrestrial
samples, have been described (<i>1-3</i>). The actual flight instrumentation and
the tests to which the flight instruments were subjected have also been
described (<i>4</i>).</p>

the manufacture of the flight instruments for the biology experiments. rigorous
clean-room techniques were employed to minimize airborne contamination (<i>5</i>),
after which the fully assembled flight hardware was heated at 120° = 1.7°C for
M hours in an atmosphere of dry 100 percent nitrogen prior to shipment to the
Kennedy Space Center. Here the instruments were installed in the landers under
clean-room conditions and heated once more when the encapsulated landers were
subjected to terminal sterilization. This time the heating regime was 112° ±
1.8°C for periods sufficient to reduce the spacecraft biological contamination
loads to acceptable limits (<i>6</i>).</p>

a month after Viking 1 went into orbit around Mars, the biology instrument was
turned on briefly for the first time since launch. At this time, 39 hours
before separation, selected valves within the instrument were automatically
closed to prevent exhaust products from entering the instrument during the
descent phase when the instrument was powered down. On 22 July 1976, 2 days
after landing, the instrument was again turned on. With activation of both
radioactivity detectors, background counts were taken in dual- and
single-channel counting modes. A chromatogram was also taken, and the
appropriate incubation cells were rotated into position to receive surface
samples. The sample for the biology investigation reported here was acquired in
the morning of sol 8 (a Mars day is called a sol and equals 24 hours 39
minutes) from the surface at a depth of 0 to 4 cm in an area consisting chiefly
of fine-grained material. The sample was introduced into the instrument via a
soil processor on top of the lander, which screened out coarse material, larger
than 1.5 min; 7 cm<sup>3</sup> of the resulting smaller-grained material was
metered down into the biology instrument. Samples for the individual biology
experiments were metered and distributed into the cells for subsequent use, as
described below. The temperature of the sample was below 0°C during acquisition
and delivery, and was 9°C during the period of storage in the test cells prior
to the initiation of the experiment. The major events for the three experiments
are outlined in Table 1.</p>

overall strategy called for relatively short incubation periods for the first
sample. If these proved negative, considerably longer periods could be used in
later incubations. Table 2 shows the various incubation sequences that are
possible for the three experiments. The second Viking spacecraft landed at a
more northerly latitude and a colder environment. After January 1977, at this
site, incubation temperatures can he significantly lowered within the biology
instrument. Part of the strategy, therefore, is to incubate martian soils at
these low temperatures.</p>

first actual science data from the biology instrument were returned from Mars 4
weeks before this report was written. In this interval, during which the
instrument functioned nominally, all three of the experiments yielded data
indicating that the surface material of Mars is chemically or biochemically
quite active. Under normal circumstances, it would be premature to report
biological experiments in progress before the data are amenable to ready
interpretation. However, the unique nature of this investigation impels us to
make this report, and we are fully cognizant of its preliminary nature (<i>7</i>).</p>

carbon assimilation experiment. </i>The pyrolytic release (PR) or carbon
assimilation experiment tests the surface material of Mars for the presence of
microorganisms by measuring the incorporation of radioactive CO<sub>2 </sub>and
CO into the organic fraction of a soil sample. The reasons for believing that
martian life, if it exists, would be based on carbon chemistry have been
summarized (<i>8</i>). The experiment is carried out under actual martian
conditions, insofar as these can be attained within the Viking spacecraft, the
premise being that, if there is life on Mars, it is adapted to martian
conditions and is probably maladapted to extreme departures from those
conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;tab-stops:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
experiment operates as follows: A sample of Mars, consisting of martian
atmosphere at ambient pressure and 0.25 cm<sup>3 </sup>of soil is placed within
the 4-cm<sup>3</sup> test cell of the instrument. Martian sunlight is simulated
by a 6-watt high-pressure xenon lamp, filtered to remove wavelengths shorter
than 320 nm. The radiant energy reaching the test chamber, integrated between
335 and 1000 nm, is approximately 20 percent of the maximum solar flux at Mars
in this spectral interval, or about 8 mw cm<sup>-2</sup>. The short end of the
spectrum is removed to prevent the surface-photocatalyzed synthesis of organic
compounds from CO that is induced by wavelengths below 300 nm (<i>9</i>).
Except under the special conditions of the photochemical synthesis, these
wavelengths are generally destructive to organic matter. It is therefore
reasonably certain that, if there are organisms on Mars, they have devised
radiation protective mechanisms. Laboratory tests have shown that the
experiment detects both light and dark fixation of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
and <sup>14</sup>CO by soil microbes (<i>10</i>), and the instrument can be
operated in either the light or dark mode on Mars. The experiments so far
conducted were performed in the light. The option exists to inject water vapor
into the incubation chamber, but it was not exercised in these experiments.</p>

the start of an experiment, 20 µl of a mixture of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2 </sub>and
<sup>14</sup>CO (92 : 8 by volume, total radioactivity 22 µc) is injected into
the test cell from a reservoir. The resulting pressure increase is 2.2 mbar
over ambient which, at the Viking 1 landing site, is 7.6 mbar. The martian
atmosphere is about 95 percent CO<sub>2 </sub>and about 0.1 percent CO. The
addition of the radioactive gases increases the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>by
28 percent and that of CO 23-fold.</p>

test chamber and its contents are illuminated for 120 hours at a temperature
that depends on both the ambient martian temperature and the quantity of heat
generated within the spacecraft. In the two experiments described, the
incubation temperatures were 17° ± 1°C and 15° ± 1°C, respectively, with a
brief upward excursion in the second (control) experiment to 20°C. This
temperature range is clearly above the soil surface temperature at the Viking 1
site, where a maximum of -5°C has been estimated during these observations (<i>11</i>).</p>

the end of the incubation period, the unreacted <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2 </sub>and
<sup>14</sup>CO are vented at 120°C from the test chamber, and the soil is
heated to 625°C to pyrolyze any organic matter it contains. The volatile
products (including unreacted <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2 </sub>and <sup>14</sup>CO
desorbed from the walls and soil particles) are swept from the chamber by a
stream of He and introduced into a column of Chromosorb P coated with CuO which
functions as an organic vapor trap, operating at 120°C. Organic fragments
(larger than methane) are retained by the column, but <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2 </sub>and
<sup>14</sup>CO pass through and their radioactivity is counted; this count is
referred to as peak 1. The column temperature is then brought to 650°C,
releasing organic compounds and simultaneously oxidizing them to CO<sub>2 </sub>by
means of the CuO contained in the column packing. The radioactivity of this <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2
</sub>is called peak 2; it measures organic matter synthesized from <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>
or <sup>14</sup>CO during the incubation period.</p>

results are shown in Table 3. Experiment 1 was an active experiment, conducted
as described above. Experiment 2 was a control in which a second portion of the
same surface sample was heated to 175°C for 3 hours before the start of
incubation. The high background radioactivity comes primarily from two
radioisotopic thermoelectric generators that supply power to the lander.
Counting times were sufficiently long to detect approximately 10 count/min
above this background. The counts were remarkably free of noise, except during
the latter part of the second experiment when some noisy segments appeared. The
noise was not random since the errors were all in the same (upward) direction.
These segments were edited out before the data were averaged. All the counting
rates summarized in Table 3 are Poisson distributed.</p>

“expected” counting rates (Table 3) are those predicted if no <sup>14</sup>C is
fixed into organic matter. These counts represent the fraction of peak 1
retained at 120°C and eluted at 650°C. This fraction is known from laboratory
tests: when peak 1 equals 10<sup>4</sup> count/min, the maximum fraction
retained is 2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> or 15 count/min for the experiments reported.</p>

96&nbsp;–&nbsp;15&nbsp;=&nbsp;81 count/min is equivalent to the reduction of 7
pmole of CO or 26 pmole of CO<sub>2</sub>. Laboratory experience based on

be demonstrated. Given the unusual conditions that prevail at the surface of
Mars, the possibility of nonbiological reduction of CO or CO<sub>2 </sub>cannot

the chamber at the prevailing pressure. The mixture of Kr, CO<sub>2</sub>, and

added to the bottom of the test cell so that the soil sample was contacted by
water vapor only, and not by the liquid medium. Results of the analyses of the
headspace gases during the humid (water vapor) mode are shown in Table 4. All

the headspace gas. Calculation of the actual gas concentrations is based on

atmosphere plus the 85 nmole consumed in the oxidation of the added ascorbic
acid). The maximum amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>produced on sol 10 is approximately
9100 nmole which decreases on sol 11 to 8800 nmole. As is indicated later, the
readsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, even after corrections for solubility, is
likely associated with basicity changes in the mixture of soil and aqueous
nutrient. No conclusion on the presence of CO can be drawn because of the low
values of the Ar and CO peak. The values of Ne and Kr demonstrate the
consistency of the internal standards and the apparent precision for the gas

The experiments described above give clear evidence of chemical reactions. The
essential question is whether they are attributable to a biological system. We

the planned experimental program is not yet completed, and partly because of
the inherent difficulty in defining complex living organisms which may have
developed and evolved in an environment completely different from that of the
planet Earth.</p>

important consideration in evaluating the possibility of life on Mars is the
chemical analysis of carbon compounds in the martian soil. Biemann <i>et al.</i>
(<i>19</i>) reported that no organic compounds larger than methanol and
propane, for example, were observed in the Viking 1 samples at detection limits
that range from 0.1 to 50 parts per billion. The results are somewhat similar
to those found in an Antarctic soil (No. 542, collected by R. E. Cameron) that
has little organic material and appears not to support an active biota (<i>20</i>).
These results, especially if reinforced by analyses at a second martian site,
would tend to make biology on Mars less likely, at least in the terrestrial
mode.</p>

contrast, the LR experiment requires conversion of oxidizable substrates into
radioactive gas. In a terrestrial test, the collective results of a positive
response in cycle 1 and its elimination by heat sterilization in cycle 2 would
support the concept that microorganisms were present in the sample. The
amplitude of the test response is an order of magnitude above that expected
from a sterile soil, and the difference between the Mars test and the control
cycle exceeds the 3&#963; level, which has been chosen as a criterion for a
positive response (<i>17</i>). However, important caveats to such a conclusion
are (i) the possible limitation of metabolism to one substrate and (ii) the
lack of an exponential phase of gas evolution indicative of growth. Organisms
in terrestrial soils attack more than one substrate, as evidenced by the fact
that the plateaus attained generally represent 50 percent or more of the total
label added (<i>17</i>). On Mars, however, utilization of only one of the
offered terrestrial substrates might indicate a selective metabolism. The
abrupt change in environmental conditions of the martian soil imposed by the
biology instrument with respect to water and temperature, together with the
relatively short time of the experiment, might readily account for lack of
growth. The absence of a positive response to the second injection in cycle 1
similar to that seen from the first injection might be attributed to inhibition
or death of the microorganisms.</p>

the suggestive character of these responses of the Mars sample, the

capable of oxidizing the labeled nutrient. However, any explanation must
account for the kinetics of the reaction as well as the heat lability of such
oxidants or catalysts at 170° to 175°C. Similarly, the absorption of
radioactive gas after the second injection of nutrient may be facilitated by
alkalinity induced in the martian soil by wetting. An absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>

<p class=ref>21.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>We acknowledge the
effective and tireless efforts of the engineers who are part of the Viking
Biology Flight team and without whom these experiments could not have been
accomplished. R. I. Gilje is chief engineer on this team, which also includes
S. Loer, C. Reichwein, G. Bowman, and D. Buckendahl. Supported, in part, by
NASA contracts NAS1-9690 (to G.V.L.), NAS1-12311 (to N.H.H.). NAS1-13422 (to
J.S.H.). and by NASA grants NGR-05002308 (to N.H.H.) and NSG-7069 (to J.S.H.).
We also acknowledge the profound contribution to the Viking mission and
particularly to the development of life detection concepts, of our former colleague
and deputy team leader. Dr. Wolf Vishniac. His untimely accidental death in
Antarctica in 1973 deprived us of his keen insight and inquiring mind at a
crucial time in this study. The invaluable assistance of Dr. Richard S. Young
in the preparation of this manuscript is also acknowledged.</p>
