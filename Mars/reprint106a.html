<table width=75% align="center">
	<tr>
		<td> 

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Barry DiGregorio first interviewed me
by phone in 1993 for an article about life on Mars. I quickly detected his
fascination with the subject. Obviously, he wasn’t just writing another
freelance, earn-a-living piece. When his story was published in <i>Final
Frontier </i>in June, 1993, his intense interest in what many have declared to
be mankind’s most intriguing question—are we alone?—became even more evident.
The article, in the form of a Q&amp;A interview, was cogently designed by Barry
to call attention to the findings of the Labeled Release experiment on Mars,
which he felt had been given short shrift by most of the Viking scientists and
had not been adequately disclosed to the public. Barry stayed in touch with me
over the next three years, telling me in 1996 of his project to write this
book. He informed me that my encounter with Mars through the LR experiment aboard
NASA’S 1976 Viking Mission would play a prominent role in his book. Barry
interviewed me frequently, gathering material for the book and requesting
various reprints of scientific publications on Mars written by me and my
colleagues. When he came to meet me in person, his interest in the Red Planet
and its attendant scientific issues constantly shone through.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>However, I already had come to
appreciate his dedication to Mars and his desire to settle the life issue.
About a year before he started this book, Barry asked my advice when he was
preparing his proposal to the Hubble Space Science Institute. Barry proposed to
view Mars through the Hubble Space Telescope, the world’s most powerful, and,
using the highly sensitive Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph, look for
hydrogen peroxide in the atmosphere and on the surface of the planet.
Unfortunately, the scientific rationale for Barry’s experiment was not deemed
sufficient by the reviewers for its selection. Barry missed his chance to
participate in what pre-Viking NASA had stated could be “the most important
experiment in the history of science,” the search for life on Mars.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>But why look for hydrogen peroxide on
Mars? In one of the classic quirks of science, the very data from the LR
life-detection test had been seized by other scientists to contend that the LR
had detected not life, but chemicals. They concluded that the LR experiment
produced “no evidence for life,” but that it did establish the presence of
chemical oxidants on the surface of Mars. It did not seem to matter that the LR
had been approved as a life-detection test by four NASA-appointed science
panels and that the experiment never had produced a false positive result from
chemicals encountered in the many Earth soils tested. On Mars, putative chemicals
seemed easier to invoke than did life.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>The chemistry advocates constructed
various theories, beginning with the “raining” of hydrogen peroxide from the
Martian atmosphere onto the planet’s surface. They contended, and still
contend, that the hydrogen peroxide destroyed any organic matter, including
life. This oxidant, they explained, either remained in the soil or, depending
on the specific theory, complexed with one or more minerals in the soil to form
strong oxidants that mimicked life in the LR experiment. The hydrogen peroxide
theory also was proposed to account for the “absence” of organic matter in the
soil of Mars as reported by the Viking Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer
(GCMS). However, as I explain later, there is no evidence for hydrogen peroxide
on Mars. Moreover, there is evidence for life existing in an Earth environment
in which hydrogen peroxide levels exceed those the chemistry advocates predict
for Mars! Other theories to attribute the Mars LR result to non-biological
reactions suffer from similar fundamental problems.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Dr. Patricia Straat, my Viking LR
Co-Experimenter, and I initially stated and subsequently maintained that our LR
data “are consistent with a biological answer.” After continuing analysis of
the data, and years of additional laboratory testing, I strengthened my
conclusion. In 1986, in a talk at the National Academy of Sciences celebrating
the tenth anniversary of Viking, I said that “more probably than not” the LR
had detected microbial life in the soil of Mars. This produced near-pandemonium
among the scientific audience. At the reception, which followed the talks,
prominent Viking scientists accused me of having disgraced myself and science.
Now, as you will be the first to learn, the facts force me to go a step beyond
my 1986 statement.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>About a year prior to NASA’s
announcement of the startling new evidence of biological fossils in the SNC
meteorites believed to come from Mars, Barry called me to say he was going to
write this book. He then paid me a visit to discuss it. During our
conversation, he revealed that the LR experiment and I were going to be
featured in his book. This placed me in a dilemma. Since I often have been
misquoted by those anxious to attribute to me more than I have said, I feared
that the careful line I have trod since Viking might be compromised if I paid
no attention to the evolving manuscript. Technical errors might inadvertently
creep into text written b even the most well-intentioned non-scientist. The
other horn of the dilemma was that, if I did review the work, I would be deemed
liable for any opinions or implications that some scientists might think beyond
the pale. Having spoken with Barry, I knew his enthusiasm would be difficult to
diminish, nor should I attempt to interfere with his views as author. After
wrestling with the problem, I offered to review the chapters with the
understanding that my factual corrections about the Viking LR experiment and
related matters would be respected, but that I would have no other control over
Barry’s literary license, including his evaluation of the LR experiment and its
scientists.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>I think Barry has done a fine job in
bringing together many discrete aspects of Mars and synthesizing them into a
fascinating story about our neighbor’s capacity to harbor life. His research of
the literature has brought forth new insights. I find his snow algae discussion
particularly interesting and, perhaps, very insightful. I have enjoyed
reviewing his work and hope that I helped with the accuracy of the explanations
of some of the scientific issues. This book is a popular version of the broad
sweep of history surrounding the enigma of Mars, which has cloaked itself more
with each attempt to penetrate its mysteries. Using my records to aid my
memory, I have tried to keep the <i>Viking </i>story straight while, at the
same time, realizing that Barry is writing for the general reader and is not
attempting a scholarly work. Accordingly, while making some suggestions that I
thought would allow scientists to enjoy the book rather than complain of
scientific errors, I have resisted my impulses to make it conform to a style
more suited for peer-reviewed journals. My disclaimer, however, is that I limit
my responsibility for strict accuracy to those parts about <i>Viking </i>and
its experiments relevant to the search for life, and other pertinent scientific
findings discussed in this chapter. I hope the book might promote the fair
hearing that the Mars LR data has never received.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>After reading Barry’s account of my
long travail, some will wonder why I “persist” in avid pursuit of the
life-on-Mars issue after twenty years; why I do not concede the issue and just
go away. It is not a matter of my persisting, the data are what persist. An
objective scientist, I cannot change my mind for expedience or comfort.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b>Viking Revisited<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>In my 1986 talk at the National Academy
of Sciences’ tenth anniversary of <i>Viking </i>I presented all the available
evidence bearing on the LR results. I concluded my analysis with the statement
that “more likely than not, the LR discovered life on Mars.” Following the
publication of news about the first Martian meteorite (ALH 84001) evidence, I
told a calling reporter that, were the analyses confirmed, I would change my
conclusion to “most likely.” When the second meteorite (EETA 79001) results
were announced, upon inquiry by another reporter, I said (again, presuming the
report valid) “almost certainly.”</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Now, ten years after my 1986 analysis,
I think new events and knowledge require another evaluation. In so doing, I
will try to address each aspect bearing on the Mars LR data and other relevant
data.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b>I.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The
LR Results<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>In all, nine LR tests were conducted on
Mars at two landing sites 4,000 miles apart. All nine supported the finding of
living microorganisms. Positive responses, similar to those obtained from Earth
soils, were obtained at each location. Heating at 160 degrees Celsius for three
hours destroyed the agent. When Viking scientists re-thought that control
measure and proposed 50 degrees Celsius as the temperature to distinguish
between chemistry and biology, two attempts were made from Earth to direct the
instrument to achieve that temperature. One achieved 46 degrees Celsius, which
produced a 70-percent reduction in the LR response, satisfying the new and more
stringent agreed-upon discriminator. The other such test brought the soil to 51
degrees Celsius, resulting in more than a 90-percent reduction in the response.
Terrestrial organisms show such narrow temperature discrimination. Fecal
coliforms, for example, are distinguished from other strains in the coliform
species by surviving incubation at 44 degrees Celsius whereas the other
coliforms, normally cultured at 35 degrees Celsius, do not.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Alas, faced with the new results, the
chemistry proponents, still constituting the majority, simply reneged on their
agreement that a major diminution in response from soil heated to 50 degrees
Celsius constituted evidence that the unheated response had been biologic. They
remained immutable even when LR tests on previously active soil samples stored
two and three months in the dark sample distributor box at 7 to 10 degrees
Celsius produced no response! Microorganisms taken from their natural
environment, deprived of their diurnal cycles, might have died.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>As stated earlier, another
non-biological theory was quickly struck down. It claimed that ultraviolet
light hitting the Martian surface “activated” it to cause a physical reaction,
releasing gas from within the LR compounds. Again, we resorted to directing <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking </i>from the Earth. Commands were
sent by which, just at dawn, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking </i>arm
stealthily moved a rock and snatched a sample from beneath it before daylight
could “activate” it. This sample, protected from light for eons, produced a
positive response within the range of the other positives!</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>There was only one result of the Mars
LR experiment that could be interpreted against biology. The experiment called
for a second dose of the radioactive solution to be squirted onto active soil
samples after the responses from the first doses had plateaued. Were life
present, a sharp increase in the evolution of gas was expected. Instead, when
the second dose was added, 20 percent of the gas that had already been evolved
disappeared from the space above the sample, reabsorbed into the soil below!
The gas slowly re-evolved over about a month. Chemistry buffs contended that
this showed that the active chemical in the soil had been used up by the first
dose and that the freshly moistened soil had re-absorbed the gas. Had a second
pulse of gas evolved, they probably would have said that the first dose of LR
compounds had been exhausted by the chemicals in the soil and that the second
dose merely supplied fresh reagent to restart the reaction. In an LR test we
later performed on lichen in our laboratory, we got a positive response but,
with excessive wetting, observed a large re-absorption of the gas evolved.
Excess moisture is known to kill these symbiotic organisms. The wetting of an
alkaline soil (such as the Martian soil was indicated to be by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking </i>analysis) results in absorption
of carbon dioxide. We demonstrated this reaction, achieving the same 20 percent
reabsorption of gas, in our laboratory LR instrument. Might the same
explanation apply to the result on Mars, especially when lichen offer a model
for possible Martian life forms?</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b>2.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>The
GEx Results<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>The GEx experiment had two stages:
first, the “chicken soup” nutrient was uncovered and only the water vapor
emanating from it was allowed to contact the soil in the test cell; in the
second stage, the soil was wetted with the soup to promote metabolism by any
organisms present. The water vapor stage produced a large burst of oxygen from
the Martian soil. Even though no light shone on the soil during the experiment,
the result was held out as possible evidence of microbial photosynthesis. When
the soil was wetted with the GEx liquid medium, carbon dioxide was rapidly
absorbed from the atmosphere into the soil but no additional oxygen evolved.
When a duplicate sample of the soil was heated as a control and then tested, it
still produced the large pulse of oxygen upon humidification. The GEx
Experimenter and the Biology Team concluded that GEx had produced no indication
of life, but of some chemical oxidant in the soil that reacted with water vapor
to yield oxygen. The possibility that oxygen adsorbed on the soil (from the
sparse amount in the Martian atmosphere) was released by the GEx vapor also was
raised, but discounted because of the large amount of oxygen released in GEx.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b>3.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>The
PR Results<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>The PR experiment produces and counts
two signals, or “peaks.” The first is from the radioactive carbon monoxide and
carbon dioxide which had been adsorbed onto soil particles in the test cell.
These adsorbed gases are released from the soil by modest heating. The second
peak comes from gases released on further heating of the soil to combustion
temperature. This signal indicates the burning of organic matter formed during
the test. If found, the second peak is the evidence for life.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>When the PR’S turn came, it produced a
very small second peak response, so small that, in Earth tests, it would have
been discounted as “noise” by Dr. Horowitz and his Co-Experimenters. ‘Vet this
was the big test on Mars, and Horowitz wanted to explore every possibility that
he might have detected life. He had the PR instrument recount the faint signal
for a full day to demonstrate that it was statistically significant above the
background noise. He published this and called the response “startling.”
However, he cautioned that ‘a biological interpretation of the results is
unlikely in view of the thermostability of the reaction.” The heated control
gave the same results as the test sample. After suggesting several
non-biological reasons for the results, Horowitz, nonetheless, stated that “it
remains to be seen whether any of the proposed mechanisms can account for the
intriguing observations,” thereby leaving the door to life open.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>While the PR signal was above the
background level, it was far short of being significant in indicating life.
Indeed, tests of the PR on Earth, both before and after the test on Mars,
showed even higher responses from control tests with sterilized soils, despite
the presence of the UV filter that had been installed to prevent false
positives. Apparently, the PR’s UV filter did not completely fulfill its
mission of removing the rays that caused photo-chemical production of organic
matter from Martian atmospheric gases. Thus, the PR experiment gave no evidence
for life. Nonetheless, the PR was a very important experiment which, until now,
has not been given due credit. It confirmed on Mars that—as in the PR tests on
Earth—organic matter is formed in the sunlit atmosphere and, even under the
continuous shining of the UV light, accumulates in the soil where the Viking
GCMS should have found it! Had these gases not been incorporated into organic
matter, they would have been blown out of the test cell during the first peak
heating cycle.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b>4.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>The
GCMS Results<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>The LR group held its breath while the
GCMS went through its motions. And, because of mechanical and design problems,
it had to perform sample acquisition twice before Klaus Biemann felt the
instrument had obtained a sample. As stated, the Viking scientists all felt
certain that there were organic compounds on Mars. Thus the mission of the GCMS
was not to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>detect </i>them, but to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>identify </i>them. Our LR group hoped that
compounds implicating life would be found. When the analysis was finished, the
results astonished everyone. No trace of Martian organic compounds was found!</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>However, the GCMS had problems which
raise questions about the validity of its findings. It could not detect some
organic matter of biologic origin in soils only sparsely populated with
microorganisms. Mechanical problems on Mars resulted in difficulty in obtaining
soil samples. The mechanical difficulty was exacerbated by the fact that the
instrument had no “tell tale” to signal the receipt of a sample. The only
evidence for samples was the observation that the sampling arm had scraped a
small ditch in the soil to obtain the sample. However, there was no way to tell
whether that sample made its way through the distribution box, which received
it, and then into the tiny ovens of the GCMS. And, if it did, the amounts that
entered the ovens were uncertain. It finally was decided that the GCMS had
obtained samples because of the amounts of water and carbon dioxide that
evolved during the heating of the samples. However, carbon dioxide constitutes
95 percent of the Martian atmosphere, and that atmosphere daily reaches 100
percent relative humidity. Since frost was deposited on the surface daily, it
also might have been deposited into the oven and sampling train of the GCMS,
along with any carbon dioxide that had dissolved in the water vapor. To what extent
these possible deposits might have figured in the GCMS results, particularly if
no sample of soil had been obtained, is unknown.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Nonetheless, the GCMS’ unexpected
result forced a dilemma on NASA and its community of scientists: how could any
thought of life be entertained in the absence of organic matter? The easy and
cautious way out was apparent. The LR had detected inorganic chemical(s), not
life. Once set, that stage has never been changed.</p>

the samples in a Viking-type LR instrument. A wide range of control regimens
was used. Under extreme conditions unrealistic for Mars we were able to force
positive results. However, no simulation of the Mars LR data could be produced
in any of our experiments or those of others when materials and conditions
known to obtain on Mars were used. We have published on all of our efforts and
on those of others that have been published or otherwise come to our attention.
A plausible reproduction of the Mars LR data by nonbiological means remains to

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Frustrated at the lack of progress in
gaining acceptance of the LR results, in 1977 I went to JPL and examined all
10,000 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking Lander </i>images then in
the JPL files. The JPL Viking Imaging System staff helped me by producing the
digitized images in “Radcam,” which means true color calibration. The first
thing I noticed was that Mars was not “uniformly orange-red” as stated in NASA
press releases. just as was shown in the first color image released, and then
promptly withdrawn, by NASA, the landscape appeared very familiar, very
Arizona-like. Generally reddish brown to brown, the landscape contained areas
of ochre, yellow, and olive. Most surprising to me were olive to yellow-green
to greenish colored areas on many of the rocks.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>One night I made the discovery that, on
some of the rocks, these colored areas appeared to show changes in pattern and
coloration from Martian year to year. I thought it was the second time I had
discovered life on Mars! I was so excited that I left JPL and drove up Angels
Crest Highway to park and study the night sky until my high wore off.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Analysis of the six channels of digital
information comprising each Viking image—red, blue, green, and three near-infra
red frequencies—showed these spots on the rocks to be the greenest objects in
the entire field of view. Thinking that the spots might look like lichen, on
one trip I brought some rocks bearing patches of lichen from Maryland to JPL. I
placed the rocks in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking 1 </i>simulated
landing site. The JPL Viking Imaging System Team took images of the rocks
through the Viking Lander Camera Imaging System. The pictures were taken under
the simulated Martian light bathing the scene. They were processed in an
identical manner to those obtained on Mars. The digital spectroscopic analysis
showed that the lichen on the rocks were the greenest objects in view.
Furthermore, the digital values of the color, hue, and saturation were very
close to those for the greenish spots on the Mars rocks. Publication of this
information in a technical paper had the reverse of the action I anticipated.
Instead of supporting the LR biological interpretation, the publication was
viewed as a desperate, non-scientific ploy. First, it was widely denied that
any greenish coloration showed on the photographs! Next, I was chastised for
supposedly intimating that there were lichen on Mars by claiming to have found
green areas.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>While working on the images at JPL, I
called their attention to one of the Viking scientists. He subsequently wrote
and published a report on the finding of greenish colored soil and markings on
the rocks on Mars. Wary of the sinkhole that awaited biological references to Mars,
he made no mention, among the many possible origins he cited for the
coloration, of any biological possibility. He even was careful not to reference
our earlier paper, nor credit my having called his attention to the colored
spots and areas. However, it only has been since publication of his report that
the presence of green spots on Martian rocks has become accepted. Recent
renderings of the Martian landscape, once again, look very much like Arizona—as
demonstrated by the carefully prepared image serving as the cover on the book <i

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>The perceived lack of liquid water on
the surface of Mars has led many scientists to conclude that life could not be
sustained there and, therefore, the LR results must be ascribed to chemistry.
“Water is life” has become a popular rallying call of the chemical
protagonists. I do not believe the answer to be as simple as that didacticism.
As with so many other questions put to Mars, it does not give a straightforward
answer with respect to liquid water. The “triple point” for water is 6.1
millibars (mb) of atmospheric pressure. If the total atmospheric pressure
exceeds 6.1 mb, water may exist in any of its three forms: solid, liquid, or
vapor, depending on its temperature. However, if the total atmospheric pressure
is below 6.1 mb, water cannot exist as a liquid. Atmospheric pressure on Mars
varies between approximately 6 and 10 mb. Thus, at times when 6.1 mb are
exceeded, should the temperature rise sufficiently to melt the abundant ice, liquid
water would result. Temperatures of the sampling arms in contact with the soil
were recorded at both Viking landing sites. The temperatures of the arms rose
as the Sun rose to and a little beyond its zenith. The temperatures of the arm
at the Viking 2 site reached 273 degrees Kelvin (0 degrees Celsius, the melting
point of water) and stayed there for a while. That means that liquid water was
present under the arms. When water transitions from solid to liquid, just
before it melts, extra heat (the heat of fusion) is required before the
temperature can continue to rise. This pause in the temperature rise is what
Viking recorded—proof of liquid water. It is true that the metal sampling arms
absorbed and stored more heat from the Sun than the soil would otherwise.
However, it is quite likely that dark rocks, and perhaps dark soil, at the
sites of both Landers act the same way. They could supply liquid water to
microorganisms if only for a brief period daily. Mars microorganisms may well
have adapted to garner needed water in this fashion. Furthermore, a new book <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>(Water On Mars, </i>M. Carr, 1996) reports
that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking Orbiters </i>found
surface temperatures reaching 298 degrees Kelvin at the summer solstice at 1
P.M. local time in the southern hemisphere, with atmospheric pressures at both
Viking sites exceeding the triple point for the 700 consecutive Martian days of
measurement. Viking also reported temperatures exceeding 273 degrees Kelvin (98
degrees Fahrenheit) in the northern hemisphere where both Vikings landed.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>At the other extreme is the possibility
that Martian organisms may be able to obtain their water from the atmosphere,
as has been reported for some lichen on Earth. While the Martian atmosphere is
only about one percent of ours, both Viking sites showed high relative
humidities, reaching 100 percent nightly. Even if the water vapor were in the
form of tiny ice crystals, these would deposit on the organisms. The organisms
might have learned to store energy from the Sun to melt the crystals and absorb
the liquid, or, as many Earth microorganisms do to prevent freezing, Martian
organisms might make antifreeze. Finally, ice crystals have been shown to
participate in chemical reactions, such as in the atmospheric destruction of
ozone by chlorofluorohydrocarbons (CFC), which is responsible for our ozone
hole. It is believed that one end of an ice crystal in a cloud remains solid
while the end in contact with the ozone and CFC behaves like a quasi-liquid and
permits the “aqueous” reaction to take place. This process may be used by
microorganisms on Mars (and, perhaps, on Earth, too!).</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>In sum, there is evidence for liquid
water on Mars. In addition, Martian organisms may be able to absorb water
vapor, or may have evolved to make liquid water from ice or to take advantage
of ice’s ability to provide an aqueous environment for reactions. Our knowledge
of the water issue—on Earth or Mars—is too uncertain to be used as an absolute
barrier to life on Mars.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>When meteorite ALH 84001, believed to
have come from Mars, was found to contain fossils indicating life, the news
startled the world. Once again, the question of life on Mars became front-page
news. Analysis indicated the meteorite to be approximately <span

billion years after the planet Mars coalesced. By then the planet had had time
to cool and become environmentally conducive to life. Liquid water is believed
to have been abundant on Mars at that time. This history closely paralleled
that of Earth, which is believed to have given rise to living organisms within
the first billion years of its formation. Since the meteorite had left Mars
before the serious environmental changes inimicable to life occurred, it was
presumed that the life present three and one-half billion years ago had since
become extinct. This scenario greatly stimulated the concept of searching for
microbial fossils on Mars rather than extant life.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>But Mars was not done with teasing
humans. Hard on the heels of SNC ALH 84001, the analysis of another meteorite
presumed from Mars, SNC EETA 79001, produced an even greater shock. This
meteorite not only confirmed the biological organic evidence of the earlier
one, but was estimated to be less than 600,000 years old! In terms of the
planetary history of Mars, this was modern times, well after the drastic
environmental changes on Mars which had been widely advertised as proof that
the Viking LR could not have detected life. This news led the chemical
theorists to conclude that Mars may have life today but, if so, it must be
hidden in very rare “oases” deep beneath the surface of the planet in pools of
liquid water heated by volcanic activity and kept from subliming into vapor by
the overlying strata.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>No one has offered to explain how the

found a precious oasis! Nor have the oasis proponents addressed a recent study
which finds that material ejected from a planet by meteoric impact comes from
near the surface not from the depths proposed for such oases.... And the
leaders of the fossil search press on with no (announced) thought that might
link the recent findings to the LR results! Darwin must be spinning in his
grave at the thought that the modern descendants of his discipline believe that
life existing on Mars during its recent era would not have survived to the
present. However, they do not deny that early Earth life was faced with a much
more desperate situation. When oxygen first appeared, produced by
photosynthetic organisms, this gas was intensely toxic to all other life forms.
However, life managed to convert that adversity to advantage.</p>

on Mars has been at a standstill for the twenty years since <i

frozen deep below the surface for millions of years have been resuscitated
instantly when brought to the surface. Microorganisms have been found growing
in cooling waters irradiated by nuclear reactors. A new kind of microorganism,
capable of living on rock and water, has been found in deep sunless pools.
Indeed, the “thin film of life” has been expanded to become a three-dimensional
continuum. Obeying Darwin’s principle of evolution, life on Earth has occupied
virtually every environmental niche, many with extreme conditions exceeding
those on the “hostile” Red Planet. Why should we expect life on Mars to have

accomplishment of the analysis of the two life-bearing meteorites is their
proof of the theory of Panspermia advanced by Svante Arrhenius in the
nineteenth century. This Nobel Laureate in chemistry envisioned that life
traveled through space, inoculating planet after planet. Whether the two SNC
meteorites come from Mars, or not, matters little in this case. What matters
most is that they do bear evidence of biology from someplace other than Earth!
This finding defeats the ultimate argument of those opposing acceptance of the
LR data—that the origin of life is such a complex process, still not nearly

microorganisms, can ride the Cosmos. The way to preserve microorganisms
indefinitely (no time limit is yet known, but it exceeds millions of years) is
to freeze them. In the laboratory we freeze and dry them. They are readily
resuscitated when placed back into an environment favorable to them. Space
travel provides the best freeze-dry process available! So, microorganisms, once
formed somewhere, can hitch rides for millions of years! Of course, while
freeing up the LR data, this new information merely pushes back the problem of
how life began somewhere.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>The conclusion that the Viking LR
results and all available relevant evidence point to the existence of
microorganisms in the soil of Mars raises the question of what type of
microorganisms they might be, Several possibilities are evident. The LR data,
the Viking images of greenish patches on the rocks, the Viking imaging system
analysis of terrestrial lichen, and the known hardiness of lichen (these
“pioneers of vegetation” are the first organisms to appear on newly formed bare
rock, such as when Surtsey rose from the sea and cooled) make lichen a good
candidate. Species on Earth are reported to survive on water obtained in vapor
form, to endure Mars-like cold, and to grow on, even inside, rocks. The
discovery and analysis of the Martian meteorites, if confirmed, would make it
extremely likely that Earth and Mars have exchanged material frequently. As
stated, space conditions are very good for the preservation of any
microorganisms inside the ejecta. Since lichen are present within rocks on
Earth, they, but not only they, make a good candidate for interplanetary
travel. If present on Mars, lichen may be widely distributed over the planet’s
surface and might have been in the LR sample. The two symbiotic components of
lichen are algae and fungi. They might also be widely distributed as individual
species, as might a great variety of other species. It seems unlikely to me
that any microbial forms would be confined to discrete “oases.” Just as on
Earth, life on Mars probably adapted to all of the environmental niches. As
pointed out earlier, those niches on Mars are much less severe than on Earth.
Even if that unlikely scenario of discrete oases were true, those oases might
still have supplied living organisms to the LR. Organisms from the oases would
have been extruded to the surface repetitively over time, perhaps by
frost-heaving or by volcanic eruption, and would have become lyophilized
(freeze-dried) by the climate. Thus preserved indefinitely, they would have
been blown by the wind and eventually distributed over the surface of the planet.
Such dormant organisms might have instantly begun to metabolize when given the
LR’s favorable environment and food. I think this hypothesis possible, but less
likely than the hypothesis that life has adapted to all Martian ecological
niches. In any event, the existence of life on Mars would make it likely that
the LR soil would have contained a viable sample.</p>

mankind’s fledgling society, were largely controlled by religion. Centuries of
effort by truly persistent scientists, some at the cost of their lives, have
still not completely freed science from the bonds of religion. However, as
science grows in scope, magnitude, and importance to our everyday lives, new
shackles have been forming around it, forged by politics and government. Over
the past half-century, science has been transformed from a discipline engaged
in by lone, gifted investigators to a major enterprise requiring elaborate
facilities, equipment, and teams of researchers. Big Science requires big
budgets. Funding for basic science, which promises no immediate financial return,
is largely supplied by government or large philanthropic agencies. They rely
upon peer review to select projects for funding. As happens within any large
organization, leaders emerge to dominate policy. The scientists, like anyone in
a supplicant situation, realize the desirability of maintaining favor to
maintain funding. They are prone to direct their efforts to areas determined as
priorities by the funding sources. They often tune their public pronouncements
to the current policies of their supporters. To do otherwise may be to incur
displeasure at the source, which, even though unintentional, could adversely
affect funding. For example, once, when I was principal investigator on a
government contract, the government contract officer paid me a usual visit to
discuss progress. After some talk, he asked me to change the direction of my
research to follow one of his ideas. I did not think it worth deviating from my
proposed course of work and told him so. He then began to insist. I then said
that I appreciated his input, but that I thought it best to stick to the plan
that his agency had approved. Then I made the mistake of adding, “After all, I
am the principal investigator and your agency is paving me to use my best
judgment in pursuing this project.” When annual funding time came around, I was
told that my project would not he continued. I never was funded by that agency
again.</p>

outside scientists supported by the agency, and those looking to the agency for
future funding took their cue. Consciously or even without overt intent, they
coalesced behind the official opinion—even to the extent of using that patently
inappropriate phrase “no evidence” to describe the LR’S findings. The unlikely
alternative is to believe that a large number of scientists do not know the

any life found. Then any samples for detailed study by human scientists should

developed. A complex environmental chamber will have to be developed to
maintain Martian atmospheric gas pressure and composition, Martian ambient
temperature cycling, Martian diurnal lighting, water content in each of the

necessary to keep the sample pristine for its examination. AND, to preserve the

It readily lends itself to expansion. It not only can confirm the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking </i>results, but also can learn more
about the life detected. This can readily be done by, first, separating its
offerings of the left-handed and right-handed molecules, then varying the
numbers and kinds of compounds to learn more about the metabolism of the life
forms found. Environmental conditions can be controlled. Thus, the responses at
different temperatures, relative humidities, amounts of water, atmospheric
gases, and the like can he determined. An Automated Microbial Metabolism Laboratory
(AMML), which Biospherics designed, built, and tested for NASA in the
seventies, uses the extreme sensitivity of the radioisotope technique to look
at the involvement of life-essential elements other than carbon, such as
phosphorus, sulfur, and hydrogen, in the metabolism of microorganisms. We also
proposed that, upon successful response to the LR probe, a subsequent mission
test for the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cellular material
detected. A robotic instrument to do this was built. Since ATP is the universal
compound through which terrestrial life obtains its energy, this test would
constitute a good comparison of Mars life to Earth life. New technologies, such
as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid mapping, will permit any
traces of nucleic acids to be amplified to the point where they can be mapped
for comparative studies.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>Many of the references supporting
statements I have made in this chapter are listed in the Reference section of
this book. I have not cluttered the chapter with individual citations. However,
a formal scientific paper supporting my new conclusion about life on Mars is
under preparation. I have been invited to present the paper at a symposium on
“Instrumentation, Methods and Missions for the Investigation of
Extraterrestrial Microorganisms” at the Annual Meeting of the International
Society for Optical Engineering, scheduled for San Diego for late July to early
August, 1997. I will update my story to try to convince my fellow scientists of
the new conclusion I have reached. I hope I can, but if not, I will continue to
take consolation in knowing that scientific progress is not a democratic process,
and I will keep trying to turn the tide. Like the Ancient Mariner, I cannot
resist telling the fascinating story about life on Mars.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>I want to acknowledge and express my
deep thanks to all the scientists, engineers, and technicians, too numerous to
mention here, who have worked with me at Resources Research Incorporated,
Hazleton Laboratories, Incorporated, and at Biospherics Incorporated over the
nearly thirty years of development and analysis of this project. Many have been
co-authors in our numerous scientific publications. All others have been
acknowledged in those publications. Foremost is Dr. Patricia Ann Straat who,
for ten years, was my right arm at Biospherics before, during, and after the
Viking Mission. For a while, she literally lived with the project, in
California, to assist in its final development, fabrication, and testing at
TRW, Inc., the manufacturer of the LR instrument, and at JPL, the NASA center
at which Viking was based. Prior to Dr. Straat’s joining our company
Mary-Frances Thompson did a splendid job as my chief assistant and oversaw our
laboratory efforts. Nor can I fail to mention the ingenuity of engineer George
Perez, who reduced my concepts to hardware in the early years.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>I am especially pleased to acknowledge
the professional contributions of my son Ron, who accompanied me at JPL during
the Viking Mission, having freshly graduated from high school. Now a Ph.D.
physicist at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, it was he who supported my contention
that the Viking data demonstrated the presence of liquid water on the surface
of Mars. He also was the first to cite Rayleigh scattering (commonly taught in
college physics courses to explain why the sky is blue) to refute the red sky
arbitrarily assigned to Mars by NASA, and he applied his capability with
computers to help me in studying the colored patches on the rocks.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>For his excellent help in editing this
chapter, I want to thank Ryan Bliss of Biospherics.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>I also want to thank the Biospherics
Board of Directors for its patience in allowing me to participate, long after
funding had ceased, in my “hobby” at the expense of more conventional and
profitable things expected of a company president.</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>It is always fitting and proper to
acknowledge family support. In this case, it’s more than a perfunctory
obligation. My wife, Karen (who also helped in editing this chapter), my sons,
Ron and Henry, and my daughter, Carol (who also contributed to this editing),
have lived with my daily struggles with Mars for more than two decades!</p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=reprint style='tab-stops:.5in'>My ultimate thanks, however, despite
the complaints I voice in this chapter and elsewhere, go to NASA, which
provided me with the most exciting scientific adventure I could ever imagine,
one that I believe is not over yet! Among the NASA officials I feel mostly
indebted to are Drs. Freeman Quimby, Orr Reynolds (deceased), and Richard Young
(recently deceased), who, as sequential early directors of the Exobiology
program, enthusiastically supported my efforts.</p>
