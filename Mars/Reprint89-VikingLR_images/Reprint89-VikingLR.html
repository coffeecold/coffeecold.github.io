style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> The final Labeled Release
(LR) cycle on each Viking lander tested a surface sample that had been stored
for several months at approximately 10°C prior to the onset of the active
sequence. At each lander site, activity was strongly diminished. This thermal
sensitivity of the active agent on the surface of Mars is consistent with a
biological explanation of the LR experiment. At the end of one of these cycles,
the incubation mixture was heated to 50°C to release any radioactive gas
trapped in the sample matrix. The results suggest that more than one carbon
substrate is involved in the LR reaction on Mars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the resulting Arrhenius plot has been used to test the fit of other flight

Mars agent. The results and their interpretation still leave unresolved the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
Viking Labeled Release (LR) life detection experiment on the surface of Mars
has now completed its activities. This communication reports, for the first
time, the flight data from the final two experimental cycles, one at each of
the two Mars landing sites.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=txt>The LR experiment monitors radioactive gas evolution following the
addition of a radioactive nutrient containing <sup>14</sup>C-labeled organic
substrates to a sample of the Mars surface material (Levin and Straat, 1976a).
A positive metabolic response is defined by evolution of radioactive gas from
an ‘active’ sample, but little or no evolution from a duplicate sample
preheated for 3 h at 160ºC (the regimen selected to destroy or inhibit any life
forms present). Extensive testing of terrestrial soils has shown these criteria
to be highly reliable.</p>

<p class=txt>The results (Klein et al, 1976; Levin and Straat, 1976b, 1977a,
1977b) obtained from such ‘active’ and ‘control’ cycles conducted on Mars
during the Viking Mission did satisfy the life detection criteria established
for the LR experiment. However, the hostile Martian environment with its
improbable availability of liquid water, cold temperatures, and intense
ultraviolet flux has led to a variety of speculations (Klein et al., 1976;
Levin and Straat, 1976b, 1977a) that exotic chemical or physical reactions,
instead of life, may have caused the LR positive responses on Mars.</p>

<p class=txt>Whether biological or chemical, the active agent is present at
both landing sites, is destroyed by heating at 160°C for three h, and its
activity is not dependent on direct ultraviolet irradiation (Klein et al.,
1976; Levin and Straat, 1976b, 1977b).</p>

<p class=txt>Because of engineering constraints imposed on the lander sampling
arms, the final two LR cycles reported herein were conducted on samples stored
in the landers for several months at approximately 10°C. In each case, the LR
response was strongly diminished. These thermal data, coupled with those from
previous cycles, are consistent with a biological explanation for the active
agent on the surface of Mars.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking Lander 1, Cycle 4.</i></b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>The LR experiment planned for the
fourth and final cycle at the Chryse landing site (VL-1) was injection of two
nutrient ‘squirts’ onto a fresh Mars sample. Previous results (Levin and
Straat, 1976b) suggested that only one of the seven <sup>14</sup>C-labeled
substrates was reacting with the Mars active agent and that this agent was
inactivated or destroyed within seven sols (one Martian sol = 24 h and 40 min),
as indicated by failure to produce a response upon addition of a second
nutrient injection. (The kinetics of the second injection are the subject of an
accompanying publication, Levin and Straat, 1979). The purpose of performing
the double injection at the onset of Cycle 4 was to determine whether the <sup>14</sup>C
substrate or the Mars active agent was limiting the LR reaction. The time
interval selected to space the two injections was three h, sufficient to
establish the magnitude of the first response, but short enough so that the
second injection would occur during the vigorous portion of the initial
reaction while the agent was still active.</p>

<p class=txt>A fresh sample of the Mars surface material was to be obtained for
this experiment, but the engineers of the Surface Sampler Team expressed
considerable concern that the sample arm might be damaged. Hence, the Biology
Team chose to utilize the sample still stored in the hopper rather than chance
not getting a fresh sample. The stored sample had been collected on Sol 91 from
the same ‘Sandy Flats’ area that had supplied the Sol 8 and Sol 36 acquisitions
which produced positive responses in Cycles 1 and 3, respectively. Between Sol
91 and the onset of Cycle 4 on Sol 230, the hopper sample had been stored in
the dark, open to the Martian atmosphere, at temperatures fluctuating between
10-26°C with an average of 10-15°C. Data from previous cycles suggested that
the Mars active agent was stable to such storage for at least five sols (see
later). The ambient Mars surface temperature fluctuated approximately between a
high of -1ºC and a low of -78°C during the corresponding storage time (Kieffer,
1976).</p>

<p class=txt>The complete results for VL-1, Cycle 4 are presented in Fig. 1. An
expansion of the injection period is shown in Fig. 2, and the overall response
is compared to those from the other VL-1 cycles in Fig. 3. As shown, the
response seen in Cycle 4 following first injection was small compared to that
seen in active Cycles 1 and 3. Following second injection, no stimulation in
the rate of gas evolution was observed other than an initial spike typically
seen upon second injection in other cycles. Gas evolution then proceeded
continuously at a low rate for the duration of the cycle.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>An estimate of the percent inhibition for Cycle 4 can be made by
comparing the results with those obtained during comparable time intervals from
VL-1, Cycle 1 and from VL-2, Cycle 1 (Table 1). These active cycles were
conducted on fresh samples and the magnitudes of their responses span the range
of active Mars responses. At 2-1/2 h following first injection, when all cycles
had received only one injection, inhibition in the Cycle 4 response was between
89 and 93%. At 200 h, when all three cycles had received two injections, the
Cycle 4 inhibition was between 80 and 87%.</p>

<p class=txt>The results indicate that storage of the Mars surface sample in
the hopper for 136 sols prior to nutrient injection severely dissipated the
active agent. Further, additional active agent was unavailable three h after
first injection since the second injection did not produce a stimulation of gas
evolution. This could be either because the amount of active agent which
survived the lengthy storage was already functioning at the maximum rate (i.e.,
substrate saturation) or because it was largely destroyed, perhaps by water
vapor, during the interim period following the first injection.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Viking Lander 2, Cycle 5.</i></b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>The fifth and final cycle planned at
the Utopia landing site (VL-2) was an incubation of a fresh sample at
sub-freezing temperatures, thereby better approximating ambient Martian
temperatures. Since the instrument’s four test cells had already been used, the
fifth cycle required addition of the fresh sample on top of a sample already
used in an earlier cycle. Previous data acquired in the Test Standards Module
(TSM), a laboratory instrument replicating the flight instruments in all
essential components (Levin and Straat, 1976a), indicated that such a
‘soil-on-soil’ experiment detects metabolic responses, but that the changed soil/nutrient
ratios could affect the kinetics of gas evolution.</p>

<p class=txt>This plan was interrupted when the sample arm failed to acquire
the fresh sample. Nonetheless, scheduled power shutdown occurred and the
biology instrument froze. When command capability was restored and the
instrument warmed to 10-15°C to thaw the nutrient, the plan had to be revised
to utilize a surface sample already present in a test cell. The sample selected
had been acquired on Sol 145 from the same area (‘Beta’) which had given active
responses in earlier cycles (Levin and Straat, 1976b), stored in the hopper for
32 sols, and then placed in an LR test cell for an additional 52 sols prior to
the Cycle 5 nutrient injection. This 0.5 cc sample was located above 1.2 cc of
surface material from a previous ‘dump’ of unused sample which was, in turn, on
top of the 0.5 cc sample used for Cycle 1. (The Cycle 1 sample had been dried
by heating 3 h at 160°C at the end of that test). Thus, the total sample volume
was 2.2 cc contained within the 3.0 cc test cell. Nutrient budget calculations
indicated that sufficient nutrient remained to assure only one nutrient
injection for Cycle 5. Incubation temperatures were maintained above freezing,
contrary to the original plan, because the stored sample had already been
exposed to temperatures above freezing, thereby defeating the purpose of the
cold incubation. Further, a second freeze might have placed undue stress on the
biology instrument.</p>

<p class=txt>The results of Cycle 5 are given in Fig. 4. Upon injection of
nutrient, radioactive gas was immediately evolved, reaching a maximum of
approximately 350 cpm over background after 90 h. This level then remained
essentially at a plateau until the end of the cycle at approximately 800 h. The
gas evolution in Cycle 5 was significantly reduced relative to that from the
other active cycles at VL-2 as Fig. 5 shows. As seen in Table 1, the percent
inhibition was greater than 90% throughout the cycle. These data support those
from VL-1, Cycle 4 (see above) that long term storage of the Mars sample in the
dark at approximately 10°C (see below) destroys the active agent in the Mars
sample.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>The conclusion from VL-1, Cycle 4 and
VL-2, Cycle 5 that long term dark storage at 10°C destroys the activity of the
Mars sample assumes that both cycles received a full measure of soil and
nutrient. Laboratory data obtained with the TSM indicate that the rates and
kinetics of gas evolution for a positive response are influenced by the
soil/nutrient ratio with the total gas evolved limited by the volume of
nutrient. A properly functioning instrument delivers 0.5 cc soil <u>+</u>20%
and 0.115 cc nutrient <u>+</u>8%. A partial nutrient delivery, which could
occur toward the end of the nutrient supply, would result in changed kinetics
and a reduced plateau level. Excess surface sample could diminish the rate of
gas evolution, whereas failure to deliver a sample would produce a response
characterized by that from nutrient alone in which a plateau of approximately
200-600 cpm is established within a few hours.</p>

<p class=txt>For both cycles, some question exists that a complete nutrient
volume was in fact delivered because both instruments were low in the supply of
nutrient. Each nutrient injection sequence requires 0.52 cc nutrient to deliver
the 0.115 cc volume to the test cell. At the onset of VL-1, Cycle 4, a
calculated 1.56 cc remained available, not including residual nutrient which
would be left in the lines after utilizing all deliverable nutrient. This
volume ensured a complete first injection and a high probability of a full second
injection. However, the kinetics of gas evolution following second injection
neither confirm nor deny that the second injection occurred. Typically, upon
second injection, a spike is seen followed by a 30-35% drop in the total
radioactive gas present such that the new level is below the plateau attained
prior to second injection. In VL-1, Cycle 4, the spike occurs, followed by a
30-35% drop, but the new level is essentially the same as that seen prior to
second injection. These kinetics could be explained either if there were no
injection or if the injection occurred while sufficient gas was still being
evolved to obliterate the drop in plateau level.</p>

<p class=txt>On VL-2, Cycle 5, only 0.64 cc nutrient was calculated to be
available at the onset of the cycle. Further, prior to the injection, the
instrument had accidentally frozen with nutrient in the lines. This may have
ruptured the delivery lines or valves. Thus, the probability of a complete
nutrient delivery for this cycle is considerably lower. However, at least a partial
injection occurred because some radioactivity was evolved in the test cell
following injection. Alternatively, this radioactivity could have resulted from
residual gas present in the delivery lines which was injected into the test
cell in lieu of nutrient.</p>

<p class=txt>The probability that sample delivery or sample size affected the
results of these two cycles has also been considered. For VL-1, Cycle 4,
calculations indicated that enough sample remained in the hopper to provide a
full delivery. The observed kinetics are atypical of a result from nutrient
alone and give evidence that a sample delivery did occur. For VL-2, Cycle 5,
the large sample volume of 2.2 cc could have affected the rate of gas
evolution. However, separate experiments conducted in the TSM that replicate
the VL-2, Cycle 5 sequence have shown that the influence of the larger sample
size on kinetics is highly soil dependent. With an iron-rich terrestrial soil,
a stimulation was seen for the excess sample size, whereas with a synthetic
Mars analog soil an inhibition was seen. Thus, the large sample in VL-2 cycles
may have caused a reduction in gas evolution.</p>

<p class=txt>In summary, then, the conclusion that the low results in VL-1,
Cycle 4 following first injection reflect inactivation of the stored sample appear
valid. The results following second injection are probably also valid. The
VL-2, Cycle 5 results tend to support the conclusion of inactivation on
long-term storage although some concern exists that the low activity may
reflect a low nutrient injection volume or the large sample size or both.</p>

VL-2, Cycle 5.</p>

<p class=ind>Stable to storage for 5 sols at 7 to 10°C. (Assumes that reduction

<p class=txt>In attempting to quantitate the thermal properties of the active
agent, the actual temperature exposure of each sample must be estimated. Upon
acquisition, each sample progresses through several stations, each with its own
thermal regime. Samples were obtained from the top 3.5 cm of Mars surface
material and transferred to the soil processor (PDA) via the collector head of
the sample arm. Collector head temperatures were assumed to be those of the
surrounding atmosphere. The total combined time in the collector head and PDA
was generally less than 2 h. The sample was sieved as it passed from the PDA
into the soil hopper (SDA) where it remained until it was distributed into the
test cell. SDA temperatures were assumed to be identical to those of the
Biology Instrument mounting plate which generally experienced a diurnal
temperature range between 10° and 23°C. Temperatures in the test cell were
maintained near 10°C with diurnal fluctuations ranging between 9° and 14°C. The
estimated temperature exposure of each sample at each of these stations is
presented in Table 2.</p>

<p class=txt>These time-temperature data may be used to generate an Arrhenius
plot representing the temperature effect on the rate of decomposition of the
Mars active agent. The overall assumptions required for this analysis are:</p>

Justification for the active agent as limiting is that commandable injection
did not produce additional evolved radioactivity, as would be expected if the
reaction were substrate limited. Also, a higher plateau would be expected if

the data treatment are described in the text.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>The data available for this temperature analysis are presented in
Table 3. For each indicated cycle, the percent loss in active agent is
estimated as a function of the treatment time, in hours, at an average
temperature estimated from Table 2. In using these data, it is noted that k
cannot be calculated for cycles which show no decomposition (i.e., c = c<sub>O</sub>)
or total decomposition (i.e., c = o). Thus, only those cycles that show
intermediate decomposition (i.e., VL-2, Cycle 4; VL-1, Cycle 4; VL-2, Cycle 5)
can be used to generate the Arrhenius plot. Of these three points, that from
VL-2, Cycle 5 may not be valid since an injection may not have occurred and
since the reaction contained excess soil which may have affected kinetics and
the estimation of activity loss. Once an Arrhenius plot is generated from VL-2,
Cycle 4 and VL-1, Cycle 4, k at any given temperature can be graphically
determined and used to test the fit of flight data from the other cycles.</p>

<p class=txt>The Arrhenius plot derived from data from VL-2, Cycle 4 and VL-1,
Cycle 4 is shown in Fig. 6. Dotted lines indicate the possible variation in
slope according to variations in the percent activity loss estimated for VL-2,
Cycle 4 and VL-1, Cycle 4 (54 to 80% and 80 to 93%, respectively). In
estimating the validity of this plot, it should be noted that the data point
derived from VL-2, Cycle 4 is perhaps the most reliable since little
uncertainty exists for both the temperature and the time of exposure. The
temperature estimate of VL-1, Cycle 4 is subject to more error since this
sample underwent diurnal fluctuations over a long period of time. However, from
the line as it is plotted, the following information may be derived:</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=num>1.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>Decomposition of the
Mars active agent has an activation energy between 35,000 and 43,000 cal mole<sup>-1</sup>,
well within the range of 15,000 to 60,000 cal mole<sup>-1</sup> cited (Daniels
and Alberty, 1955) for most chemical reactions.</p>

<p class=num>2.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>The temperature required
for a 99.9% reduction within 3 h of treatment is between 53° and 60°C. Thus,
the 3 h of treatment at 160°C that occurred on VL-1, Cycle 2 would be expected
to result in 100% decomposition. This deduction is consistent with data
obtained from the mission. Also, the storage for 21 sols at 10°C prior to the
160°C treatment would have resulted in no more than an 8% activity loss.</p>

<p class=num>3.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>Essentially no
decomposition would be expected for the time-temperature regimes experienced
prior to the onset of VL-1, Cycle 1 (2 sols at 10°C) or VL-1, Cycle 3 (2 sols
at 18°C). Further, essentially no decomposition would be expected for the 5 sol
storage of VL-2, Cycle 2 prior to cold sterilization. These predictions are
also consistent with data obtained from Mars.</p>

<p class=num>4.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>For VL-2, Cycle 5, a 10
- 20% decomposition is predicted. This is inconsistent with flight data which
showed a 97% decomposition.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt style='text-indent:0in'>Thus, with the exception of VL-2, Cycle 5,
the flight data are consistent with the Arrhenius plot generated from VL-2,
Cycle 4 and VL-1, Cycle 4. The inconsistency of VL-2, Cycle 5 may support the
hypotheses either that injection was faulty or that the large sample affected
the kinetics of gas evolution. Alternatively, the inconsistency may reflect an
incorrect assumption in the highly simplified data treatment. It should be
noted that the activation energy calculated from VL-2, Cycle 4 and from VL-2,
Cycle 5 is between 23,000 and 27,000 cal mole<sup>-1</sup>. However, when this
value is used to test the fit of other flight data, predicted inhibitions in
all cases are greater than observed on flight. This may be additional evidence
that the data from VL-2, Cycle 5 may not be valid.</p>

<p class=txt>Other important information can be deduced concerning the Mars
active agent. It is apparently stable to ultraviolet radiation as evidenced by
its presence on or just below the exposed Mars surface. On the other hand, its
stability does not depend on direct ultraviolet radiation since activity
observed with a sample taken from under a rock (VL-2, Cycle 3) was essentially
identical with that obtained from an exposed surface sample (Levin and Straat,
1976b).</p>

Heating of Cycle 4<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt style='text-indent:0in'>A single nutrient injection into the LR
test cell contains approximately 257,000 cpm with each of the 17 carbons of the
seven substrates contributing approximately 15,000 cpm (corresponding to 29
nmoles of carbon). For the four cycles conducted with active surface samples
(VL-1, Cycles 1 and 3; VL-2, Cycles 1 and 3), the maximum radioactivity evolved
ranged from 11,000 to 16,000 cpm, possibly corresponding to total utilization
of only one of the carbon substrates. This suggested (Klein et al., 1976) that
a chemical reaction was occurring between formate, assumed to be the most
reactive of the LR substrates, and some surface oxidant.</p>

<p class=txt>To test the possibility that more than one substrate may have been
involved, the VL-1, Cycle 4 incubation mixture was heated to 50°C at the end of
the cycle (Sol 287) to drive off any radioactive gas trapped within the sample
matrix during the 55 Sol incubation period. From previous laboratory studies
(Levin and Straat, 1976a), this mild treatment was known to have no effect on
the decomposition or volatilization of residual nutrient substrates remaining
within the sample. VL-2, Cycle 4 had demonstrated that heating to 50°C severely
attenuated the active agent, so that the terminal 50°C heating of the reaction
mixture would likely not produce new gaseous products. When planning this
experiment, it was hoped that the active sample would produce a radioactive
plateau of either 16,000 cpm (from one injection) or up to 32,000 cpm (from two
injections assuming active agent at the time of the second injection). If the
mild heat treatment would release additional gas trapped within the sample, to
exceed the 16,000 or 32,000 cpm plateau, this would establish that more than
one carbon substrate was involved in the LR reaction. As discussed above,
however, the stored sample used for VL-1, Cycle 4 showed a reduced response and
had evolved only 3000 cpm by the time of the 50°C terminal heating.</p>

<p class=txt>The results of the heat treatment are shown in Fig. 7. 
During heating, the detector heaters produce ‘noise’ such that
the gas level cannot be determined. As soon as these heaters were turned off
and accurate counts obtained, the radioactivity level was 20,954 cpm,
approximately 18,000 cpm above the initial value for the gas present in the
headspace prior to the heating. (It should be noted that this cannot reflect
simply heat-driven movement of the gas from the headspace of the test cell into
the detector chamber since the detectors are simultaneously heated to 110°C,
considerable above the test cell 50°C). As the test cell cooled, the
radioactive gas was quickly reabsorbed and the level dropped to 6600 cpm within
the 2-1/2 h required for the test cell to return to 10°C. The gas level then
gradually decreased at approximately a linear rate. By Sol 300, the level was
3800 cpm where it remained steady until data collection terminated on Sol 303.</p>

approximately 3 h of heating at 50°C. During this time, the ‘noise’ produced by
heating the detectors to approximately 110°C prevented monitoring the level of

immediately after turning off the heaters. Radioactivity and temperature

<p class=txt>Assuming the same phenomenon during previous active cycles, at
least an additional 18,000 cpm would have been generated as gas and remained
trapped in the sample-nutrient mixture. Thus, the 10,000-16,000 cpm level
observed for active cycles may represent only a portion of the total gas
evolved. Because each carbon position contributes approximately 15,000 cpm, the
gas evolved may have been derived from at least two carbon positions. This
could be accomplished by oxidation of one substrate composed of two carbons, or
of two substrates, assuming one is formate. Alternatively, the gas could also
be generated by partial oxidation of several or all substrates. However, the
latter alternative is less likely in view of the apparent first order type
kinetics observed (Levin and Straat, 1979) for the Mars LR active response.</p>

<p class=txt style='text-indent:0in'>The data obtained from the final two
cycles of the Viking LR experiment on Mars have further delineated the thermal
sensitivity of the active agent responsible for the positive LR responses reported
from earlier cycles. These data are consistent with a biological explanation
since Mars organisms would be expected to be sensitive to temperatures
significantly above that of their native habitats. The long-term storage
temperatures of approximately 10°C are considerably above the -21°C to -84°C
temperatures at which the samples were collected (Table 2). Since few chemicals
would be destroyed or dissipated by such a low temperature, these data make
biology an attractive possibility.</p>

<p class=txt>Alternate explanations which invoke a chemical agent must account
for the marked thermal sensitivity. Several exotic chemicals have been proposed
that might form on the surface of Mars as a result of ultraviolet radiation in
the presence of trace amounts of water vapor. Among the candidates are various
metal peroxides, superoxides, or ozonides. Most of these compounds, however,
cannot account for the thermal properties of the active agent (Vol’nov, 1966).</p>

<p class=txt>Of these compounds, hydrogen peroxide seems the leading candidate
and was early proposed (Oro, 1976b) to account for the LR reaction on Mars. The
LR reaction appeared to be first order, seemingly involving only one substrate,
and a reaction between formate and hydrogen peroxide was put forth as the
source of the LR response.</p>

<p class=txt>The properties of hydrogen peroxide have been extensively
summarized (Edwards, 1962; Schumb et al., 1955). At 760 mm Hg, anhydrous
hydrogen peroxide melts at -1.7°C and boils at 152°C. Pressure has a
significant effect and, at 30 mm Hg, the boiling point is depressed to
approximately 72°C. At 6 mm Hg, the approximate pressure at which all Mars
samples were stored and the pressure at which heat treatments were begun, a
further depression of the boiling point to 41°C can be calculated.</p>

<p class=txt>The production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the Martian
atmosphere and its freezing out on the surface of the planet have been
postulated (Parkinson and Hunten, 1972; McElroy et al., 1977) in a hypothetical
model of the aeronomy of the lower atmosphere of the planet. Hydrogen peroxide
frozen in the surface sample, when warmed to the incubation temperature of the
LR experiment, could react with the LR medium evolving radioactive gas.
However, a problem remaining to be solved concerns the ability of the hydrogen
peroxide formed on Mars to survive. The oxidant is highly susceptible to
photolysis by ultraviolet light which, on Mars, penetrates to the surface
virtually unattenuated by any ozone layer. The rate coefficients cited
(Parkinson and Hunten, 1972; McElroy et al., 1977) for the formulation and
destruction of hydrogen peroxide on Mars favor its destruction by a factor
exceeding 10<sup>7</sup>. Moreover, freezing would not protect the compound
from photolysis (Edwards, personal communication). Some form of protection or
complexing would be required to preserve the compound or to form a UV stable,
but thermolabile precursor.</p>

<p class=txt>Hydrogen peroxide decomposition is known to be first order
(Harned, 1918). When hydrogen peroxide activation energies are measured under
conditions such that only decomposition can account for its disappearance,
values of approximately 48,000 cal mole<sup>-1</sup> (Edwards, 1962) are
obtained. Thus, were hydrogen peroxide the active agent, the decomposition
activation energies expected from the Mars samples would likely have been
higher than the observed 37,000 to 42,000 cal mole<sup>-1</sup>. On the other
hand, should some of the active agent escape through evaporation, the apparent
activation energy would be lowered. In the LR experiments, both decomposition
and vaporization were likely involved with vaporization playing a relatively
more significant role at lower temperatures. In the long term storage
experiments at approximately 10°C, the Mars samples were open to the Mars
atmosphere. The various heat treatments were performed in closed test cells,
but the test cells were vented to the atmosphere for four min after the heating
cycle. Each arrangement would probably allow a significant quantity of hydrogen
peroxide vapor to escape from the reaction volume. The differences in
activation energies, then, are in the correct direction and the similarity of
the known hydrogen peroxide decomposition activation energy to that derived
from the flight data is of considerable interest. However, another aspect of
the Arrhenius plot remains to be considered. A nonstabilized 90% wt. hydrogen
peroxide solution decomposes at the rate of about 0.001% per h at 50°C
(Edwards, 1962; Schumb et al., 1955). Thus, although the slope of the Arrhenius
plot for hydrogen peroxide decomposition may parallel the flight data, the ‘y’
intercepts of the two sets of data are considerably apart. In order for
hydrogen peroxide to fit the flight data, its decomposition in the Mars sample
would have to be catalyzed to effect a significant lowering of the temperature
at which it decomposed.</p>

<p class=txt>The Mars surface material with its constituent metals could
provide such a catalyst. To fit the necessary requirements, the particular
catalyst would have to account for a postulated free radical chain length of
about 10<sup>9</sup> in order to reconcile the frequency factor (A) calculated
from the flight data with the normal frequency factor for the decomposition of
peroxides (log A<sub>flight</sub> - log A<sub>normal</sub> = 23 - 14 = 9)
(Edwards, 1978 personal communication). The catalyst would also have to possess
the property of effecting the slow decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide under
anhydrous conditions at 10°C while not precluding a continuing reaction over
many hours between the peroxide and the LR labeled substrates when nutrient was
added into the test cell at 10°C.</p>

<p class=txt>Although the data cannot at present be entirely accounted for by
chemical hypotheses, they remain consistent with biological explanations.
However, biological approaches to resolving the LR enigma are not possible
short of another Mars mission. Hence, our laboratory efforts are directed
toward chemical experiments which can reduce the area of ambiguity, ideally
achieving general acceptance of biology or chemistry as the source of the LR
reaction.</p>

<p class=txt>Such chemical work in progress in our laboratory has, so far, not
replicated the kinetic and thermal data obtained from Mars. Chemical or
physical models tested include ultraviolet and gamma irradiation (Levin and
Straat, 1977a) and calcium peroxide and superoxide additions (Levin and Straat,
1979) to ‘Mars analog soils.’ Experiments with hydrogen peroxide in the
laboratory and in the TSM under Mars conditions are in progress. Additional
experiments are under consideration to effect the formation of hydrogen
peroxide under Mars conditions, in the event some complexing will occur with
‘Mars analog soil.’ Perhaps such a complex could achieve the characteristics
necessary to duplicate the LR Mars data.</p>
