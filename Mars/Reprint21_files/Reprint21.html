exploration. The development of systems capable of launching satellites and
space probes requires a highly coordinated and intensive effort in the physical
sciences. It was only natural that such a program, developed largely by
physicists, should emphasize physics in early space experiments. Moreover, many
experiments in physics were necessary first steps into space. As payload
capacity for probing space was actually achieved, biologists, who hitherto had
had little cause for more than general interest in rocketry, became more
attentive to the possibilities thus opened for biology and stressed the need
for including their science in space program planning. Experiments were
incorporated in instrument packages. and effects of the space environment on
the metabolism and genetics of microorganisms and small animals were studied.
The manned-flight and space-medicine efforts have also provided biological
information, although these programs are directed toward accommodating man in
space. Now, with the continued growth of thrust and guidance capabilities,
biologists suddenly find themselves on the brink of one of man’s most
tantalizing experiments—the search for life beyond his planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>With the beginning of modern science, information slowly
accumulated bearing on the possibility that life exists on other planets. a
question hitherto thought approachable only through philosophy and theology.
The search for scientific data on this question had been confined to our solar
system because of technological limitations. From feeble rays of light,
carefully gathered and analyzed, astronomers and physicists deduced some
pertinent facts or indications. Recently, radar and light waves have been
directed at the planets so that the reflected energy might bring back with it
information concerning surface conditions. Observations of the moon and planets
have been summarized by Kiess and Lassovsky (1), by Kiess and Birney (2), and
by the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences (3). Most
recently, Salisbury (4) discussed findings pertaining to the question of life
on Mars. On the basis of observations and deductions, interest had focused on
both Venus and Mars. However, recent data obtained by Mayer and his associates
(5) have convinced these workers and others that the surface temperature of
Venus is above the melting point of lead. Consequently, Mars is now thought to
be the planet (with the exception of the earth) most capable of supporting
life, and it has been selected by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as the first planet to be probed by instrumented landings in an
effort to find evidence of life forms. Landings within this decade are planned
(6) which conceivably could resolve this age-old speculation. Among the
instruments tentatively selected for the first landing is “Gulliver,” a
miniature mechanical device which, like the Gulliver after whom it is named,
will seek exotic forms of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

our solar system, even the doubters generally agree that life-detection

moisture, chiefly in the form of ice crystals; (iii)&nbsp;a blue haze, which

that might best be used to detect such forms—forms which even a human observer
might fail to recognize. Hence, since we know that the many life forms on our
planet are basically similar to one another in biochemistry and in structure at
the cellular level, and since we know how to look for them, it is only logical
that the first extraterrestrial life probes should seek life of an aqueous and
carbonaceous nature. Of course, the possibility remains that alien life which
evolved independently, isolated from our own, may have nothing in common with

The presence of moisture would seem to be the key, and moisture may exist in
sufficient concentrations only locally. Observers have suggested that the
moving bands mentioned earlier are bands of moisture advancing seasonally from
the polar ice caps. Some scientists think we should try to obtain a moisture
map of Mars by orbiting an infrared scanning satellite around it before
undertaking exploration to detect life. Such a map might indicate that life
exists only at particular times and places. The life probe would be sent to the
area nearest the equator that has moisture and other favorable characteristics.
This approach would make it possible to select carefully a place or places to
land the necessary life-detection apparatus and to choose the most favorable
time of the year and even the most favorable portion of the day for conducting
the experiment. While this may be the ideal approach, it would be some time
before the moist regions could be charted, and an even longer time before we
would have the capability to land an instrument package at a particular time
and place on Mars. On the other hand, if the observed yellow clouds are dust
storms caused by high winds, microorganisms would be widely disseminated and
localization of moisture in life-sustaining quantities might not be a
significant factor. If bands of moisture traverse the planet, microorganisms
might thrive during the moist intervals, remaining dormant during dry periods,
or they might be continually blown about, advancing with the moist front.
Otherwise, some unlikely form of motility must be hypothesized, for life cannot
evolve anew during each moist period. Thus, at least in spore or dormant state,
life on Mars may be ubiquitous on the surface and directly above and beneath
the surface, as it is on the earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It also seems that a micro form would be easier to capture and examine than a
macro form, although it is quite possible that microorganisms exist on Mars in
far fewer numbers per unit area than on the earth. When all of the foregoing
factors are taken into consideration, there seems to be a chance that an
appropriate experiment with limited probing facilities, landed without a high
degree of site selection, could succeed in detecting life on Mars, should any
exist. Although the hazards of rocketry, guidance, and mechanical failure may
make the chance of success a fairly slim one, the reward would be so great that

gases as end products derived from labeled substrates metabolized by microorganisms.
These end products are the result of a number of alternative metabolic
reactions, and a system based on their detection has a greater chance of
success than one based on detection of a specific intermediate via a particular
enzymatic reaction. Enzymes are complex molecules whose intricate structures
render them highly specific in reacting with substrates. It is conceivable
that, in a separately evolved biology, enzyme structures and intermediate
products would be different from those on earth but that some of the same end
products would be produced. The relative simplicity of gases evolved by
microorganisms as compared with the complexity of the enzymes and substrates
strongly favor this possibility. Conversely, if life exists which evolves no
gases, or which evolves gases quite different from the few familiar ones of
metabolic origin, then the enzymes and intermediate products will almost
certainly be different from those we know. While the most universally evolved
gas is carbon dioxide, the possibility of also seeking other gases, such as
hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, molecular hydrogen, and methane through substrate
labeling is being considered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

incorporated into the test media. The isotopes must be metabolized and
incorporated into an evolved gas; they must be utilized by a wide range of
organisms; and they must exhibit chemical stability. On the basis of these
criteria a number of radioactive substrates have been tested, singly and in
combination. These have included sodium formate-C<sup>14</sup>, glucose-C<sup>14</sup>
(uniformly labeled), sodium acetate-1-C<sup>14</sup>, sodium pyruvate-1-C<sup>14</sup>,
glycine-2-C<sup>14</sup>, cysteine-S<sup>35</sup>, a yeast extract randomly

labeled with C<sup>14</sup>. The most satisfactory of these has been a
combination of formate and glucose. The activity level is 5 microcuries of each
substrate per milliliter of medium. With these substrates, a medium has been
developed which supports the evolution of detectable levels of C<sup>14</sup>O<sub>2

period ranging from minutes to several hours. The group which responds includes
aerobes, anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, thermophiles, mesophiles,
psychrophiles, heterotrophs, phototrophs, autotrophs, spore formers, and
nonspore formers. The composition of the medium is shown in Table 1, and
typical responses are shown in Table 2. Photosynthetic anaerobes may be
prevalent on Mars, and it is especially encouraging to find a positive response
from <i>Rhodospirillum rubrum</i> which was grown anaerobically and
photosynthetically at the same time. Positive responses, although variable and
relatively slow, have been obtained from the autotrophs <i>Thiobacillus

include a basic salts medium, a salts-plus-casein hydrolyzate medium, a medium
containing some of the extracts now being used, and a simple soil extract with
radioactive glucose and formate. Response to the other media has indicated that
the degree of complexity of the medium of Table 1 is the most satisfactory. One
may hope that, at best, 80 to 90 percent of the wide variety of organisms
tested will respond. If microbial life does exist on Mars, it is likely that it
will be heterogeneous and that some types will respond to the medium which is
ultimately developed. It should be pointed out that testing of most of the
organisms has been under environmental conditions approximating the habitat of
the type in question. The purpose has been to determine a response under
natural conditions, on the assumption that Martian organisms will be tested
under their own conditions. In other words, no attempt is being made to impose
Martian conditions in the present testing of organisms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(13). An “exploded” view of the second, and current, model is shown in Fig. 8.
The instrument weighs approximately 1½ pounds and demands a power peak of 2
watts for several minutes and power of 200 milliwatts thereafter. According to
the present concept, the life-detection experiment would be conducted as
follows. Gulliver is mounted inside the instrument capsule of the vehicle. When
the vehicle is still some distance from Mars, the capsule is ejected into a
capture trajectory. The main body of the vehicle, containing the bulk of the
various experiments associated with the mission, conducts these other investigations
while flying by the planet, radios the data to the earth, and continues on into
space. The capsule enters the Martian atmosphere and deploys a parachute to
effect a “soft” landing. After the capsule ceases rolling, an ampule containing
the radioactive medium is broken. Simultaneously, an ampule containing a weak
acid is broken; the acid is thus permitted to generate nonradioactive carbon
dioxide from an adjacent carbonate or bicarbonate. A pressure-release valve
permits the gas to flush the radioactive medium to remove low levels of C<sup>14</sup>O<sub>2
</sub>generated within the medium by radioactive self-degradation during the
voyage. The flushed gas is vented to the Martian atmosphere through a
pressure-controlled valve. During this flushing operation, which lasts several
minutes, two projectiles mounted in the capsule (each containing 23 feet of
sample-collection line) are fired across the Martian terrain. One end of each
line is attached to the reel inside the culture chamber. The other end is
merely coiled inside the projectile head and is thus laid out over the ground
surface. The lines, which are impregnated with Silicone grease for maximum
adhesion of particulate matter, are wound into the culture chamber, carrying
with them particles of soil obtained from the 46 lineal feet of contact with
Mars. Weak spots, or tensile fuses, are built into the lines so that, in the
event the lines become tangled with objects on the terrain, failure will occur
at a point close to the obstruction, permitting return of the greatest possible
amount of sample. While the sample port of the culture chamber is open to
permit entry of the lines, the interior volume reaches equilibrium with the
Martian atmosphere. The temperature of the medium will be kept slightly above
freezing; in other respects the environment in the chamber and the local
environment will be identical. After the lines have been reeled inside the
culture chamber, the port closes, sealing the chamber. A background count of
the chamber is made. The radioactive broth is then transferred from the
flushing chamber into the culture chamber, immersing the sample-retrieval
lines. Mounted immediately above the culture chamber is a solid-state, beta
detector coated with barium hydroxide. The C<sup>14</sup>O<sub>2 </sub>evolved
in the culture migrates to the detector and precipitates on it as barium
carbonate. A system of baffles between the medium and the detector prevents
direct reading of beta activity in the medium by obstructing the line of sight.
At 15-minute intervals the radioactivity accumulated on the detector is read by
a scaler, and the data are relayed directly to the earth by radio transmission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Figures 9 and 10 show the results obtained from such tests. In all these
figures the presence of at least two different organisms is clearly evident.
There is also a possibility that three organisms are represented in Fig. 9. In
the case of Fig. 9 the test was made by first sterilizing the basic instrument
without the electronic components but with projectiles, retrieval lines, motor,
and charges in place. With all openings to the outside covered to maintain
sterility, the instrument was carried into the field, and the entire procedure
was carried out by manual application of electric pulses from a battery. After
the retrieval lines had been reeled into the chamber the unit was carried into
the laboratory, where the detector and scaler were connected and the
radioactivity was monitored. Sample collection was made from frozen ground in a
Washington park while the air temperature was about 0°C. Modifications of the
experimental procedure were made in obtaining the results shown in Fig. 10. A
programmer was used to sequence and carry out the entire procedure; the tests
were conducted during warmer weather and were completed outdoors instead of in
the laboratory. Of two complete units planned for the capsule, one serves as a
control for the experiment through injection of an antimetabolite. While
generation of the typical population growth curve is good evidence of metabolic
activity under the conditions of the test, if, with a similarly inoculated
chamber into which an antimetabolite had been introduced, the curve were
attenuated, the case for life would be difficult to dispute. Furthermore, in
the event that the cells are in a lag or resting phase or that the generation
period is so long that the exponential portion of the curve is not observed,
the control permits detection of respiration levels of C<sup>14</sup>O<sub>2</sub>
evolution. Of course, selection of a universal antimetabolite for hypothetical

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

efforts to increase the sensitivity of the radioactivity-counting technique. As
mentioned earlier, incorporation of other labels will be explored. If other
labels are included, the gas adsorption surface will have to be changed so that
it has an affinity for the various labeled gases that might be evolved.
Extensive time-response curves are being accumulated for the test organisms in
pure cultures and soils, for comparison with results from the Mars experiment
and for study of the sensitivity of the method with the different species
through correlation of response levels with size of inoculum (14).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

data Gulliver may transmit from Mars? A positive response from the test chamber
and a negative or significantly lesser response from the control chamber would
be strong grounds for concluding that life exists on Mars. It is likely that
such a result would give some information concerning the life found. The
existence of more than one type of microorganism, the physiological state of
the organisms, the duration of lag periods and generation times might be
deduced from the data. If both test and control chambers gave positive results,
this might be interpreted as evidence that the life found was resistant to the
antimetabolite, that the antimetabolite was not injected, or that high
background radiation masked the experiment. In this case, the shape of the
curves might indicate which conclusion was the most credible. Any positive
response might be the result of contamination from the earth, but sterilizing
the capsule and instruments will have made such contamination very unlikely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

increasingly sophisticated experiments. Only slight modification in approach
and instrumentation would be required to adapt the present system to perform a
wide variety of analyses. Specific metabolic reactions under various environmental
and nutritional conditions could be determined for comparison with reactions of
earth organism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

microorganisms having a biochemistry similar to those on earth were not present
at the time and place of sampling. Equipment failure could also cause negative
results. The data obtained might pinpoint some failures, but others conceivably
could not be distinguished from negative test results, since weight
restrictions would not permit inclusion in the capsule of extensive systems for
verifying the operation of the equipment. Under no conditions would a negative
response rule out the possibility of life, but a series of negative results
might lead one to suspect that, if organisms exist on Mars, they are very
different from any on earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:

to determine types, habitats, environmental ranges, distribution, population
densities, and biochemistry for comparison with life on the earth. From such studies
the important question of whether life on the two planets is of common origin
may be answered. In any case, whether or not life forms on Mars and the earth
are related, new knowledge would be gained concerning the evolution of life on
the two planets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
