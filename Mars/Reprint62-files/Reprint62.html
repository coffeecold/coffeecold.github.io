<i>The Mariner 9 infrared spectroscopy experiment has provided good-quality
spectra of many areas of Mars, predominantly in the southern hemisphere. Large
portions of the thermal emission spectra are significantly affected by dust
with a silicon oxide content approximately corresponding to that of an
intermediate igneous rock, thus implying that Mars has undergone substantial geochemical
differentiation. Derived temperature profiles indicate a warm daytime upper
atmosphere with a strong warming over the south polar cap. Atmospheric water
vapor is clearly observed over the south polar area and less strongly over
other regions.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>The infrared
spectroscopy experiment on the Mariner 9 mission was designed to provide
information on atmospheric and surface properties by recording a major portion
of the thermal emission spectrum of Mars. The original intent was to determine
vertical temperature profiles, the surface temperature, and the atmospheric
pressure at the surface, and to acquire information related to the surface
composition. The experiment also was designed to search for minor atmospheric
constituents, including H<sub>2</sub>O vapor and isotopic components of CO<sub>2</sub>
<i>(1)</i>. The biological implications of the Martian environment were to be
studied. Although the Martian dust storm has complicated the task of attaining
the scientific objectives originally formulated for a dust-free atmosphere,
unexpected information was obtained on the dust composition and on the general
circulation associated with the storm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>The Michelson
infrared interferometer spectrometer (IRIS-M) records the spectral interval
from 200 cm<sup>-1</sup> (50 µm) to about 2000 cm<sup>-1 </sup>(5 µm) with a
nominal spectral resolution of 2.4 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the apodized mode of data
reduction. A noise equivalent radiance of about 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> watt cm<sup>-1</sup>
steradian<sup>-1</sup> has been achieved. The field of view is almost circular
with a half cone angle of 2.25 deg. Wave-number calibration is provided by a
fringe control interferometer for which the 0.6929-µm line of a Ne discharge
source is used as a standard. Intensity calibration is achieved by scaling Mars
spectra to calibration spectra recorded periodically during alternate
observation of deep space and of a 296.4°K on-board blackbody. After Fourier
transformation and scaling of the raw spectra in an Earth-based digital
computer, the individual calibrated spectra are displayed in absolute
radiometric units as a function of wave number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>On a planetary
scale, the Martian spectra obtained so far exhibit a fair degree of uniformity
in comparison with similar spectra obtained from the Nimbus satellites for
Earth <i>(2)</i>. The major exception in the appearance of Martian spectra
occurs in the vicinity of the south polar cap. Examples of nonpolar and polar
spectra are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-autospace:none'>-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>Major features
common to all spectra are the two broad regions at 400 to 600 cm<sup>-1</sup>
and 850 to 1250 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which appear in absorption in the nonpolar
spectra arid in emission in the polar spectra. and, the molecular absorption by
CO<sub>2 </sub>in the range from 540 to 800 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The differences in
appearance of the spectra may be qualitatively ascribed to differences in the
atmospheric temperature profile, the underlying lower boundary surface, and the
amount of dust in the atmosphere. In most of the nonpolar spectra, all of the
molecular bands of CO<sub>2 </sub>appear in absorption, an indication that the
atmospheric temperatures decrease with height on a gross scale. In the polar
spectrum, the parts of the spectrum from 550 to 625 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 700 to
800 cm<sup>-1</sup> appear in emission, an indication that the lower
atmospheric region in which this radiation originates is at a warmer
temperature than the underlying surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>The most
striking result of the experiment thus far is the strong effect of the
atmospheric dust on the emission spectra. The entire spectrum, with the
exception of the strongly absorbing part of the 667-cm<sup>-1</sup> (15-µm) CO<sub>2</sub>
molecular band, apparently is influenced to varying degrees by the opacity of
the dust in the atmosphere. A rigorous treatment of spectra from a dust-laden
atmosphere must be based on a radiative transfer model which incorporates
absorption and. scattering by the dust along with molecular CO<sub>2 </sub>absorption.
Until that treatment can be accomplished, more simplified methods must suffice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>The diffuse
features appearing near the 470- and 1075-cm<sup>-1</sup> absorption in nonpolar
spectra and near the 470- and 1075-cm<sup>-1</sup> emission in polar spectra
are attributed to dust particles in the atmosphere. The features are
characteristic of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>bands in silicate-bearing minerals. Lyon <i>(3)</i>,
Hovis <i>(4)</i>, Aronson <i>et al.</i> <i>(5)</i>, Salisbury <i>et al.</i> <i>(6)</i>,
and Conel <i>(7)</i> have shown that the spectral position of absorption and
reflection peaks depends on the silica content; acidic minerals [70 to 75
percent (by weight) SiO<sub>2</sub>] suspended in powder form absorb most
strongly at 1100 cm<sup>&#8209;1</sup>, whereas ultrabasic materials (less than
45 percent SiO<sub>2</sub>) show absorption peaks near 950 cm<sup>-1</sup>. A
preliminary comparison of the emission features measured over the south polar
region with the absorption spectra of fine dust measured by Lyon shows
generally good agreement with those of minerals and rocks whose SiO<sub>2 </sub>content
is in the intermediate range (55 to 65 percent), but poor agreement with highly
acidic (greater than 65 percent) as well as basic (45 to 55 percent) and ultrabasic
material. Silicates are also indicated in nonpolar areas. If this result is
substantiated by continuing analysis (additional laboratory measurements of
emission and absorption spectra of various dust samples, radiative transfer
calculations for a scattering and absorbing atmosphere, analysis of additional
spectra), its implications are of great planetological significance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>There is at
this time no agreement on whether Mars is differentiated [see <i>(8)</i>, for
example]. The SiO<sub>2</sub> content of planetary surfaces is probably the
best gross geochemical indicator of the degree of differentiation. Thus, the
relatively high SiO<sub>2 </sub>content indicated by these preliminary results,
if representative of the Martian surface, would show that Mars has undergone at
least as much differentiation as the moon <i>(9)</i>, and perhaps as much as
Earth. In this discussion it is assumed that the suspended dust has the same
bulk composition as the surface rocks. This assumption is based on the probable
absence of extensive chemical weathering on Mars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>The fact that
the silicate features associated with the dust appear in emission in the polar
spectra confirms that the absorption is produced by dust suspended in the
atmosphere rather than the surface itself. The strength of the dust features in
the spectra indicates a fairly substantial optical depth for the dust,
especially in the regions away from the south polar cap or away from high
plateaus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>It has thus far
been possible to observe the Martian surface only in the region of the south
polar cap, and perhaps over highlands, where the atmospheric dust is
sufficiently thin. For quantitative interpretation, it is first necessary to
establish the radiance originating from the planetary surface. This radiance,
in general, depends on the emissivity of the surface material, the degree of
homogeneity of the surface within the field of view in terms of temperature and
composition, and the opacity of the dust-filled atmosphere. From a working
model, a background radiance curve for the average south polar spectrum shown
in Fig. 1B has been calculated and is included in Fig. 1B. In the model it is
assumed that an unknown fraction of the field of view is filled with a
blackbody emitter at one temperature, whereas the rest of the field of view is
filled with a blackbody at a second temperature. The model is based on the fact
that the apparent size of the cap is slightly smaller than the IRIS field of
view and is heterogeneous in structure. By using measured radiances at 295,
840, and 1330 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and by assuming that the measured radiances are
unaffected by the atmosphere and by the dust in it, a fit was obtained with 65
± 5 percent of the field containing an emitter at 140° ± 10°K and the remainder
of the field filled with an emitter at 235° ± 10°K. This result is consistent
with a frozen CO<sub>2 </sub>cap, in agreement with earlier work <i>(10)</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>Estimates of
the vertical temperature structure of the Martian atmosphere can be obtained
from measurements in the 667-cm<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2 </sub>absorption band by
inversion of the integral equation of radiative transfer. If the atmospheric
transmittance is known, the temperature as a function of atmospheric pressure
can be derived. Preliminary retrievals of temperature profiles have been made
on the assumption that the atmosphere consisted of 100 percent CO<sub>2</sub>,
and on the basis of the neglect of possible additional opacity due to dust. A
knowledge of surface pressure is also required for an accurate specification of
temperature in the lower atmospheric levels. The apparently near-isothermal
structure of the lower atmosphere and the effects of dust opacity have
prevented determination of surface pressure from the spectral data. Therefore,
use has been made of surface pressure estimates from Earth-based measurement
and front Mariner 6 and 7 data in regions where such data exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>Examples of
retrieved profiles are shown in Fig. 2. The profiles over Hellas and Sinai are
typical of those obtained from spectra similar to the nonpolar cases of Fig.
1A. Surface pressure was estimated for Hellas from Mariner 7 ultraviolet
spectrometer measurements <i>(11)</i> and for Sinai from Earth-based radar
measurements <i>(12)</i>, which were normalized at coincident points to Mariner
6 ultraviolet spectrometry pressure estimates. The lower lapse rates below 2 mb
may be real. However, if the dust has an optical depth in the 15-µm band at
this level of approximately unity, a similar effect will result, regardless of
the true thermal structure in this region. When the optical depth of the dust
is less than unity, the temperature retrieval data will be essentially
unaffected by the presence of the dust. As the optical properties of the dust
become better understood, the lower portions of the profiles therefore may be
subject to revision. The temperatures above 2 mb are generally warmer than
either those predicted theoretically for a dust-free atmosphere <i>(13)</i> or
those obtained from the Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 occultation experiments <i>(14)</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>A profile
obtained over the south polar cap is included in Fig. 2. The most outstanding
feature is the pronounced temperature inversion, which is responsible for the
fact that the CO<sub>2</sub> bands are seen partly in emission as in the polar
spectrum shown in Fig. 1b. Surface pressure estimates are not yet available in
this region, but the basic behavior of the profile was essentially unaffected
as the surface pressure varied from 5 to 20 mb. Only the profile obtained with
a surface pressure of 10 mb is shown. Figure 3 shows isotherms for a vertical
cross section along a single scan pass down onto the cap and back off the cap
again. The lower part of the diagram is uncertain because of the neglect of
dust in the analysis and lack of knowledge of the surface pressure. The cross
section shows a highly localized region of warm air at approximately 1 to 2 mb
in the vicinity of the cap. The substantial solar illumination during the south
polar summer, the reflection of solar energy by the cap, and atmospheric
dynamical effects are all possible mechanisms that could produce this effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-autospace:none'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;text-autospace:none'>The polar
spectra also shows rotational lines of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor in the region
between 200 and 350 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This portion of the IRIS spectrum from
Fig. 1B has been expanded in Fig. 4. Consistent with atmospheric temperatures
warmer than surface temperatures, the H<sub>2</sub>O vapor lines appear in
emission. Also shown in Fig. 4 is a synthetic slant path spectrum composed by
the use of the two-surface temperature model described above. The excellent
spectral correspondence of atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>O vapor in the south polar
region. Spectral features of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor appear more weakly over other
regions of the planet. Possible reasons for the fact that H<sub>2</sub>O vapor
is not more prominent there may be sought in the near-isothermal nature of the
temperature profiles, the shielding effect of the dust, or possibly a lower H<sub>2</sub>O
vapor concentration away from the south pole.</p>
