style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The infrared spectroscopy experiment
on Mariner 9 provides extensive information on the Martian environment, including
spatial, diurnal, and secular dependences of atmospheric and surface
parameters. Measurements obtained during and after the planet-wide dust storm
indicate that large diurnal variations in atmospheric temperature existed up to
at least 30 km; winds inferred from the temperature fields show a strong tidal
component and significant ageostrophic behavior. With the dissipation of the
dust, the maximum in the atmospheric temperature field moved from approximately
latitude –60º and late afternoon local time to near the subsolar point in
latitude and time. Analysis of spectral features due to the atmospheric dust
indicates a SiO<sub>2 </sub>content of 60 ± 10%, implying that substantial
geochemical differentiation has occurred. Water vapor estimates indicate
abundances of 10-20 precipitable micrometers, less than has been inferred by
ground-based methods in similar phases of previous Martian seasons. Between
November 1971 and April 1972 no gross latitudinal or temporal dependence in the
water vapor distribution has been detected from the south polar region to the
equator. Water vapor has not been detected over the north polar regions.
Surface pressure mapping has been carried out from which topographic relief of
nearly two pressure scale heights is inferred. Extensive regions have been
found where the surface pressure exceeds the triple-point pressure of water.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A measurement
of the thermal emission spectrum yields much information on the environment and
climate of a planet. In certain spectral intervals the remotely sensed radiance
originates at the surface, in others the emission comes from atmospheric gases
and aerosols. This property of the thermal emission permits retrieval of
surface and atmospheric temperatures, surface and atmospheric compositions, and
total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in an atmospheric column. Other parameters, such
as surface pressure and topography, and the wind field may then be derived.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However, to
extract this information the spectra must have adequate spectral resolution
(&lt;5 cm<sup>-1</sup>) to at least resolve details in the contours of gaseous
absorption bands and must be recorded with adequate precision. Instrumentation
for infrared emission spectroscopy on the Nimbus earth satellites successfully
demonstrated the feasibility of this technique for meteorological and
geophysical investigations.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Infrared
emission spectroscopy on Mars has been applied from the ground (e.g., Sinton
and Strong, 1960) and from spacecraft (Mariner 6 and 7, Horn <i>et al.</i>,
1972). However, only the orbiter Mariner 9 could explore the thermal emission
of Mars systematically. This was the scientific objective of the infrared
interferometer (IRIS) experiment. The more specific goals have been detailed
previously (Hanel <i>et al.</i>, 1970<i>a</i>) and preliminary results have
already appeared (Hanel <i>et al.</i>, 1972<i>a</i>). The present paper is a
further report on results of continuing data analysis and conclusions through
May 1972.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Michelson
interferometer on Mariner 9 records the spectrum between 200 and 2000 cm<sup>-1</sup>
(5 and 50 µm) with a nominal spectral resolution of 2.4 cm<sup>-1</sup>
(apodized) and spatial resolution of about 125 km at periapsis with vertical
viewing. A noise-equivalent-radiance (NER) of 0.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> W cm<sup>-2</sup>
sr<sup>-1</sup>/cm<sup>-1</sup> has been achieved.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The instrument
is in many respects similar to interferometers flown in earth orbit on Nimbus 3
and 4 (Hanel <i>et al.</i>, 1970<i>b</i> and 1971). However, the Mariner
interferometer covers a wider spectral range and has a higher spectral
resolution as well as a lower NER than the earlier Nimbus instruments. The
Mariner interferometer has a single infrared detector (a thermistor bolometer)
and a cesium iodide substrate for the beamsplitter coatings. The Michelson
mirror moves with a constant velocity during the recording of an interferogram.
Wave-number calibration is provided by referencing all infrared spectra to the
0.6929-µm line of a neon discharge tube. Other details of the design and
performance of the Mariner interferometer are discussed elsewhere (Hanel <i>et
al.</i>, 1972b).</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Calibration spectra
are periodically recorded while observing either deep space or an on-board
blackbody. Scaling of the raw Martian spectra to the calibration spectra
permits a display of the Martian spectra in radiometric units. The calibration
method of the Mariner interferometer is similar to that of the Nimbus
instruments previously described (Hanel <i>et al.</i>, 1972<i>c</i>). A final
calibration must include second-order effects. Two such effects for which
allowance was made in the calibration of the Nimbus 4 data are not present in
the Mariner instrument. The absence of an asymmetry in the response of the
Nimbus instrument between the earth and space ports was verified on Mariner by
measurements just before Mars encounter. The other effect arose from small
temperature oscillations of the Nimbus instrument due to periodic loss of
thermal control. In the Mariner IRIS the thermostat has worked well within the
design range, controlling the instrument temperature to within a fraction of a
degree.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The only
second-order effect incorporated so far in the Mariner 9 calibration procedure
is necessary to account for the imperfect blackness of the warm calibration
source, which is an aluminum plate with 30º V-shaped grooves painted with
3M401-C10 black velvet paint. While this paint is relatively black over most of
the instrument spectral range, small glass beads contained in it give rise to
emittance variations of a few percent at 1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 480 cm<sup>-1
</sup>which are characteristic wavenumbers of SiO<sub>2</sub>. A correction
factor was derived from laboratory reflectance measurements on a duplicate
blackbody, from similar measurements on the same type of paint, kindly made
available by James Aronson (private communication), and finally by comparisons
of the warm and cold calibrations on the interferometer while in orbit around
Mars. All three methods were in agreement and, consequently, the emissivity
correction of the warm calibration source has been applied to all spectra shown
in this paper.</p>

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPECTRA<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since the
arrival of Mariner at Mars in November 1971 the interferometer has produced
over 20000 spectra showing variation with Martian coordinates, local time,
season and secular events such as the dust storm. The substantial differences
between spectra from the north polar hood, the south polar region, and
midlatitudes on Mars, and from the Sahara desert are evident from Fig. 1.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Throughout the
range from 250 to 500 cm<sup>-1</sup> numerous rotational lines of water vapor
are evident [Figs. 1(b) and (c)]; the strongest lines (at 254, 278, 303, 324,
and 328 cm<sup>-1</sup>) are used for the determination of atmospheric water
vapor content. Within the range from 500 to 800 cm<sup>-1</sup> the main
spectral features are due to numerous bands of carbon dioxide. The theoretical
carbon dioxide spectrum is not in quantitative agreement with the observed
spectra at 579, 608, 710, 730, and 770 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Readjustment of the
theoretical line parameters is expected to eliminate most of these
discrepancies. Weak carbon dioxide bands are seen at 828, 865, 961, and 1064 cm<sup>-1</sup>
[Fig. 1(c)]. Comparison of theoretical and observed spectra also indicates that
the isotopic ratios of <sup>12</sup>C to <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>16</sup>O to <sup>18</sup>O
on Mars are close to their terrestrial values. The broad diffuse absorption
feature, Fig. 1(c), centered at approximately 1100 cm<sup>-1</sup> and a
smaller feature near 480 cm<sup>-1</sup> are associated with dust suspended in
the atmosphere. Another weak feature at approximately 1350 cm<sup>-1</sup> is
also tentatively identified with the suspended dust.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The spectrum
[Fig. 1(a)] of the north polar area (revolution 102) closely resembles that of
a 145K blackbody except in the CO<sub>2</sub> band between 600 and 700 cm<sup>-1</sup>.
There the higher intensity indicates a warmer atmospheric layer above a lower
boundary having approximately the condensation temperature of CO<sub>2</sub>.
The south polar spectrum [Fig. 1(b), revolution 29] has already been discussed
(Hanel <i>et al.</i>, 1972<i>a</i>); the shape of the CO<sub>2</sub> band
indicates the presence of a strong temperature inversion. The Martian
midilatitude spectrum [Fig. 1(c), revolution 92] is compared to a Sahara spectrum
[Fig. 1(e)] recorded by the Nimbus 4 meteorological satellite. Measured over a
similar spectral range and with nearly the same spectral and spatial
resolution, these spectra provide the opportunity for a comparative analysis
between Mars and Earth. Similarities in the CO<sub>2</sub> band [Fig. 1(c) and
(e)] indicate that temperatures decrease with altitude in both atmospheres
except at high altitudes where the reversal of the <i>Q</i> branch (667 cm<sup>-1</sup>)
in the Sahara spectrum is caused by a temperature inversion due to heating by
ozone. Indication of such an inversion is lacking in the Martian spectrum.
Further, the 1042-cm<sup>-1</sup> O<sub>3</sub> band, so prominent in the earth
spectrum, is absent in the Martian spectrum. Water vapor lines appear only
weakly in Mars although strongly evident on Earth. Shown in Fig. 1(d) is the
spectral emissivity of quartz (pure SiO<sub>2</sub>, fractured solid sample).
This feature may be recognized in the Sahara spectrum between 1080 and 1250 cm<sup>-1</sup>
The corresponding silicate dust features on Mars are somewhat different because
of the effects of particle size, mineral composition, and suspension in the
atmosphere, as will be discussed later.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Water vapor in
the Martian atmosphere has been conclusively identified from rotational lines
which are evident in the observed spectra, Fig. 1(b) and (c). Preliminary
analyses of the spatial and temporal change in the water vapor have been made
for several regions on Mars: the south polar area, midlatitude regions near the
subsolar point, and over the north polar hood. South polar passes were analyzed
from revolutions 30 (<i>L<sub>s</sub></i> = 297°) and 116 (<i>L<sub>s</sub></i>
= 321°), where <i>L<sub>s</sub></i> is the planetocentric longitude of Mars
(The American Ephemeric and Nautical Almanac, 1971, 1972). Subsolar passes were
selected early in the mission on revolution 20 (<i>L<sub>s</sub></i> = 293°),
where the atmosphere was nearly isothermal, on revolution 92 (<i>L<sub>s</sub></i>
= 314°) during the transition period from a dusty to a clear atmosphere, and on
revolution 174 (<i>L<sub>s</sub></i> = 336°) after the atmosphere had cleared
substantially and the temperature lapse rate had increased to between 3 and
4K/km. Local times were restricted to 1200&#8209;1400 hr when the surface
temperature attains its maximum value, thus maximizing the thermal contrast
between surface and atmosphere; this in turn enhances the H<sub>2</sub>O lines
in the observed spectra. For each water vapor determination ten to fifteen
spectra are averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The total H<sub>2</sub>O
content is determined from a quantitative comparison of observed and
synthesized spectra. The synthetic radiances were calculated by a numerical
integration of a solution of the radiative transfer equation. Temperatures
obtained from the inversion of the 667-cm<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> band, as
discussed below, and a constant H<sub>2</sub>O mixing ratio were used. The latter
is assumed based on the evidence of strong vertical and horizontal mixing
indicated by the existence of the dust storm and by the wind fields discussed
below. Synthesized and observed spectra for the south polar area are compared
in Fig. 2; the former are offset vertically for clarity. Synthesized spectra
with 10-20 precipitable micrometers of water vapor give best agreement with the
observations. Similar comparisons for the subsolar-point cases yield also
abundances in the range of 10-20 precipitable micrometers. Over the north polar
hood water vapor was not identified, presumably due to the low temperatures
which would cause most of the water to condense. It should be emphasized that
estimates of the water vapor content are extremely sensitive to the surface
pressure, the temperature difference between the surface and the lower
atmospheric layers, and to the temperature gradient in the lower portion of the
atmosphere. With refinements in these parameters the estimated amount of water
vapor is also subject to adjustment.</p>

results from both IRIS spectra and ground-based observations are summarized in

(1970). The horizontal dashed lines represent mean values from the ground-based

measurements. All ground- based observations represent averages over the entire
disk of Mars. In contrast to the above measurements, the results from the
1.38-µm water-vapor band experiment on Mars 3 (Moroz and Ksanformaliti, 1972)
indicate substantially lower water vapor amounts.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From these
results it may be concluded that the average abundance of atmospheric water
vapor decreased slightly as the entrained dust settled but then increased after
atmospheric clearing during the late southern summer, <i>L<sub>s</sub></i> =
350—360°. The latitudinal and seasonal changes of atmospheric water vapor on
Mars are often correlated with changes in the polar caps (Barker <i>et al.</i>,
1970; Schorn, 1971). However, in 1971 the water vapor content did not decrease
towards the equator from the receding south polar cap as would be expected if
it were the source of vapor. Latitudinal gradients were noted from the north
polar cap during the 1969 opposition (Tull, 1970). Perhaps most significant,
however, is the fact that the average abundance of water vapor for the entire
planet is lower than in previous oppositions. This lower abundance could be due
to an unusually large amount of water trapped in the north polar cap; some
evidence of anomalous behavior during tile northern autumn is evident from the
extension of the north polar hood to lower latitudes than in previous
corresponding seasons.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Alternatively,
however, the unusually low water vapor content may be associated with
adsorption on dust particles. Experimental and theoretical investigations by
Davis (1969), Pollack <i>et al.</i> (1970), and Fanale and Cannon (1971) have
indicated that adsorption of water vapor by the Martian regolith may be a
significant mechanism in governing vapor abundance. In general, gas is adsorbed
at low temperatures and desorbed at higher temperatures. It is suggested that
the suspended dust provided additional surface areas to permit more efficient adsorption
and that much of the water then settled with the dust. With increasing
temperatures at the surface some of the water vapor may return to the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As more and
more refined water vapor analyses are available a more quantitative

precise value. While the shallow minimum of the brightness spectrum could
conceivably be affected by unrecognized instrumental effects, the standard
deviation depends much less on the absolute calibration. Shown in Fig. 5 is the
same midlatitude average spectrum (Rev. 92) displayed in Fig. 4(a), together
with the standard deviation &#963;(<i>T</i>). The ensemble of spectra was
chosen between 1200 and 1400 hr local Mars time. Over this period, the surface
temperature is near its diurnal maximum and is expected to change very little
between individual samples. The lower atmosphere, however, is still warming as
indicated by the maxima in standard deviation near 600 and 730 cm<sup>-1</sup>.
At these wavenumbers atmospheric emission originates primarily between the
3-mbar level and the surface. A low standard deviation in the center of the
667-cm<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> band indicates stable temperatures at higher
levels. The strong maximum at 1090 cm<sup>-1</sup> is caused in part by
temperature fluctuations in the lower atmosphere but also by the local
variability of the dust among spectra in the ensemble. In either case the
maximum variation is expected to occur at the most absorbing wavenumber. This
occurs at 1090 cm<sup>-1</sup>, in agreement with the results obtained from the
brightness temperatures.</p>

any geochemical conclusions from the chemical composition of the Martian

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A possible parallel
to the Martian situation may be provided by terrestrial wind-deposited
sediments (loess), found in large areas of North America, Europe, and Asia.
Pettijohn (1957, p. 378) lists chemical analyses of 5 loess samples from the
United States, China, and Belgium, with the following weight percentages of SiO<sub>2</sub>:
59.3, 61.0, 64.6, 72.8, and 74.5. These values are somewhat more siliceous than
the average continental crust, which is about 60% SiO<sub>2</sub> according to
studies by Ronov and Yaroshevsky (1969). However, it is apparent that no gross
chemical fractionation occurred in these sediments.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A second
aspect of the question involves possible chemical fractionation by grain size
of wind-deposited sediments. As Pettijohn (1957, p. 101) shows, chemical
composition of terrestrial sediments (including water-deposited ones) is
strongly dependent on grain size. Fine-grained sediments tend to be richer in
clay minerals (chiefly kaolinite, about 46% SiO<sub>2</sub>), and
coarse-grained ones richer in quartz (pure SiO<sub>2</sub>); thus fine-grained
sediments are generally less siliceous than coarser-grained ones. Terrestrial
loess has grain sizes largely between 30 and 60 µm (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 378),
compared with the average grain size of less than 5 µm for clay (Krumbein and
Sloss, 1951, p. 71), a major constituent of terrestrial sediments as a group.
Evidence by IRIS and other experiments (Moroz and Ksanfomaliti, 1972) indicates
that the dust particle size is a few micrometers. It is therefore expected that
the dust is probably somewhat less siliceous than the rocks from which it is
derived.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From the above
evidence, it appears that the present estimate of 60 ± 10% SiO<sub>2</sub> for
the Martian dust composition is probably fairly representative of the mean
composition of the Martian crust. This being so, it supports the conclusion
that geochemical differentiation of Mars has occurred (Hanel <i>et al.</i>,
1972<i>a</i>). Comparison of various differentiated and undifferentiated bodies
is shown in Table I. The conclusion that Mars is differentiated is further
supported by the existence of volcanoes and lava fields discovered by the
television experiment on Mariner 9 (McCauley <i>et al.</i>, 1972). Many of the
lava flows, such as those in the Nix Olympica-Tharsis region, appear similar in
morphology and scale to basaltic lava flows as seen on terrestrial orbital

estimates of wind fields consistent with the observed mean atmospheric

models of the longitudinally averaged temperature fields were constructed from
measured atmospheric temperatures obtained on orbits 1-85 and 161-186. The
model temperatures consist of an axially symmetric component and a sinusoidally
varying diurnal component. The lapse rate and the location of temperature
maxima in altitude, latitude and local time have been incorporated into the

of the large elevation differences found on Mars, the effects of topography on

highly uncertain due to the vanishing of the Coriolis terms and dominance of

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Mariner 9 has
produced data suggesting that the prospects for life on Mars, deemed negligible
since Mariner 4, are significantly increased. IRIS has shown that
differentiation has occurred on Mars. Dynamic events such as dust storms, high
winds, hazes or clouds, and polar cap transformations have also been recorded.
Mariner 9 television data (McCauley <i>et al.</i>, 1972) have indicated that
faulting, volcanism, wind and water erosion have been active forces on the
planet. Many of these processes are conducive to the evolution of life. For
example, differentiation of the planet makes lighter elements more readily available
for evolutionary processes at the surface. Dynamic processes ensure the
exposure and mixing of possible life precursors and nutrients. Further, they
create a diversity of habitats essential for divergent evolutionary processes.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Trace
atmospheric constituents, which might possibly imply surface metabolic
processes in accordance with the theory of Hitchcock and Lovelock (1967) and
Dayhoff <i>et al.</i> (1967), have so far not been identified in IRIS spectra.
However, the observed atmospheric composition, atmospheric pressure,
temperature, and surface conditions do not preclude the existence of an
independent life on Mars. The general lack of significant amounts of water has
been considered the major life-limiting factor (Mariner-Mars 1969: A
Preliminary Report, 1969). Since liquid water may currently be lacking on the
planet surface and only traces of water vapor exist in the atmosphere, Martian
life would have had to adapt to extreme aridity or have become restricted to
limited areas where liquid water may be available at least transitorily.
Topographic results discussed above indicate that liquid water could exist in
extensive areas on the surface of Mars if adequate sources of juvenile water
were present; such areas then represent the most likely places to explore the
possible existence of life.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It is
generally agreed (Morowitz, 1968) that, if life has evolved on Mars, both
phototrophic and heterotrophic organisms are required to harness the sun’s
energy and to maintain nutrient cycles. Assuming the existence of microbial
life, the dynamic surface forces indicated by Mariner 9 suggest that
heterotrophic microbial forms (and chemoautotrophs) would be widely
distributed. Microbial phototrophs, on the other hand, may have been selected
against and, if extant, would probably be restricted to microhabitats where
they are protected from the shifting dust which would otherwise exclude the
sun’s energy.</p>

Martian conditions do not preclude the survival of some known earth life forms

readily be cited which grow in saline water, acidic and alkaline solutions, at
freezing temperatures, or anaerobically under carbon dioxide. These
considerations, coupled with the dynamic mechanisms available on the planet for

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Preliminary
analysis of Mariner 9 IRIS data through May 1972 has thus far revealed spectral
features due to CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapor, and silicate dust suspended in the
atmosphere. A number of significant results have been obtained and conclusions
have been reached.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Water vapor
abundances of 10-20 precipitable micrometers were found both during the dust
storm and as the dust dissipated, in general agreement with ground-based
measurements obtained during the same period. However, ground-based
measurements obtained in previous years during similar Martian seasonal
conditions have indicated larger amounts of water vapor. No significant
latitudinal variation in water vapor was observed from the south pole to the
equator.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A study of
spectral features due to the dust indicates a SiO<sub>2</sub> content of 60% ±
10%. Arguments have been given which indicate the surface material should be as
least as acidic as the atmospheric dust. These results support the conclusion
that geochemical differentiation has occurred on Mars.</p>

pressure have been estimated using measurements in the wing of the 667-cm<sup>-1</sup>
CO<sub>2 </sub>band. Preliminary results demonstrate the usefulness of this
technique for obtaining surface topography over large portions of the planet.
Topographic variations of the order of 2 pressure scale heights have been
found, and large regions exist for which the pressure lies above the
triple-point pressure for water.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Atmospheric
temperatures, also derived from the 667-cm<sup>-1</sup> CO<sub>2 </sub>bands,
always showed subadiabic lapse rates as well as unexpectedly large diurnal
variations of 15-30 K. The maximum temperatures occurred late in the afternoon
near latitude -60° during the dust storm, but moved toward the subsolar
latitude and shortly after local noon as the dust cleared. Unlike the
atmospheric temperatures, the surface temperatures displayed a maximum shortly
after local noon and near the subsolar point at all times.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Winds derived

hydrodynamic equations indicates the existence of significant cross-isobaric

<p class=nrmtxt><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At present, no
results indicative of biological activity have been obtained. However,
conditions for life on Mars have been found to be less harsh than previously
thought. These findings validate the continuing efforts in the search for life
on Mars. Further, the possibility that terrestrial microorganisms may survive,
if not actually grow, on Mars, emphasizes the importance of sterilization of
future landers.</p>

certain is your identification of SiO<sub>2</sub>? Is that the only compound
present or could there be others as well?</p>

<p class=nrmtxt>HANEL:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
identification of SiO<sub>2 </sub>was based on a number of bands so that the
identification is positive. However, it is not necessarily <i>pure</i> SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>SEYMOUR HESS:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What were
the magnitudes of the winds which you calculated from your temperature
distribution?</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>HANEL:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At one scale
height we got between 20 and 30 meters per second. However, this result is only
preliminary, being based upon a linearization of the Navier-Strokes equations
and without considering topography.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>MAROV:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Did you find any
difference in the humidity before and after the dust storm?</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>HANEL:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the beginning
of the storm we found less water vapor, but this may have been due to
obscuration by the dust.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>SAGAN:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wind speeds of
20-30 m/sec are about what others have obtained from model calculations before
introducing topography. Did your value of 140K for the polar cap temperature
apply to both early and late orbits?</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

compare with other estimates of the fraction of the surface covered by frost?</p>

conditions did you use?</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>HANEL:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We used a
temperature distribution according to our measurements, and a surface which had
no topography and had constant pressure.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>HESS:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The effect of
topography on the winds is primarily thermal. That is, the surface controls the
temperature at the boundary. Your solution may already reflect the topographic
effect because you actually measured the temperature distribution.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=nrmtxt>SAGAN:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Winds of only
20-30 m/sec won’t lift dust, so <i>something</i> else is happening which
increases the wind velocity.</p>

<p class=nrmtxt>ANDREW YOUNG:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dr.
Hanel’s solution is referred to a constant-pressure surface, but the real
surface has variable pressure. This is the difference between his solution and
one which explicitly includes topography.</p>
