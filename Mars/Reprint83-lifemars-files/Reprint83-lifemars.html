<font face=arial size=2>Viking radiorespirometry (&quot;Labeled Release&quot; [LR] ) experiments
conducted on surface material obtained at two sites on Mars have
produced results which on Earth would clearly establish the presence
of microbial activity in the soil.  However, two factors on Mars
keep the question open.  First, the intense UV flux striking Mars
has given rise to several theories postulating the production
of highly oxidative compounds.  Such compounds might be responsible
for the observed results.  Second, the molecular analysis experiment
has not found organic matter in the Mars surface material, and
therefore, does not support the presence of organisms.  However,
sensitivity limitations of the organic analysis instrument could
permit as many as one million terrestrial type bacteria to go
undetected.
<p>
Terrestrial experiments with UV irradiation of Mars Analog Soil
did not produce Mars type LR results.  Gamma irradiation of silica
gel did produce positive results, but not mimicking those on Mars.
 The life question remains open.

The Viking Labeled Release (LR) Experiment (Levin and Straat,
1976) has obtained results consistent with the presence of microbial
life on Mars.  In the LR experiment, a dilute aqueous solution
of simple, uniformly labeled carbon compounds is applied to a
sample of soil in a sealed test cell.  The headspace atmosphere
in the chamber is monitored for the appearance of radioactive
gas.  A positive response is tested for biological lability by
repeating the experiment after heating a duplicate portion of
the sample to 160&#176;C to sterilize it.  Tests conducted with
terrestrial soils containing viable microorganisms invariably
produce positive responses and, under favorable environmental
conditions, gas evolution plotted as a function of time reveals
the classic microbial growth curve with lag, exponential and stationary
phases clearly defined.
<P>
Prior to Viking launch, a carefully controlled LR experiment was
conducted in a sister instrument to those flown to Mars.  The
atmospheric composition and pressure, the water vapor content
and the temperature of the test cell containing a California soil
with a rich microbial population were controlled to simulate conditions
anticipated within the test cell on Mars.  The results of the
active and control cycles are presented in Fig. 1 as the cumulative
evolution of radioactive gas over Martian sols (1 sol = 24.6 h).
 At the point indicated in Fig. 1, a second aliquot of the radioactive
nutrient was injected onto the soil which immediately produced
a fresh radiorespirometric response.  In the control sequence,
a duplicate portion of this soil was heated to 160&#176;C for
3 h and permitted to cool prior to nutrient injection.  As seen
in Fig. 1, essentially no gas evolved.

<p>As of this writing, two active cycles of the LR experiment have
been performed at each of the two Mars lander sites some 4000
miles apart.  All four active cycles have yielded positive, and
surprisingly similar, results upon their first injections.  However,
rather than producing additional gas, subsequent injections in
each cycle have all produced diminutions in the accumulated quantity
of radioactive gas already evolved.  Typical results, those for
VL-1, Cycle 3, are presented in Fig. 2. During this long incubation,
a total of three nutrient injections were made.  The first produced
a strong positive response, but the second and third were followed
by a decline in the amount of radioactive gas evolved by the first,
indicating a drastic change or loss of the active agent in the
soil sometime prior to the second injection.
<P>

<p><p>Fig. 3 summarizes the current first injection data at Viking Lander
1. Two active cycles and one control cycle are presented on a
scale comparable to that used in Fig. 1 to permit ready comparison
of the Mars and Earth results.  Similarly, the current first injection
results at Viking Lander 2 are summarized in Fig. 4 to the same
scale.<br><br>

<center><img src="fig3.gif" width="485" height="270"></center>
<p>

Comparison of the results from all four Mars active cycles to
the results obtained from terrestrial soil under simulated Mars
conditions, Fig. 1, shows that, with respect to the first injection,
the responses are similar in magnitude over the time span measured.
 The shapes of the first injection portions of the active cycle
curves on Mars and on Earth differ in that the Mars responses
approach plateau earlier in the time course.  Nonetheless, the
similarity among all four active tests on Mars is striking.  This
is despite the fact that one of the experiments, VL-1, Cycle 3,
was conducted on a sample obtained by moving a rock which had
protected it from UV radiation for many thousands of years.  It
is interesting to note that, while the Mars data fail to show
evidence of exponential gas evolution, from which growth might
be inferred, neither do the terrestrial microorganisms under the
imposed Martian conditions.  The 160&#176;C preheated control
samples produced similar, low level results on Earth and Mars.
<P>
Although the LR results are consistent with the presence of life
on Mars, other factors prevent the indicated conclusion at this
time.  Experimenters for the other two Viking life detection experiments,
Pyrolytic Release and Gas Exchange, have stated (Horowitz, 1977)
that their experiments have produced no confirming evidence. 
Also, the Molecular Analysis Experiment (Biemann, 1977) has found
no evidence of organic matter in the Martian surface material.
 However, the sensitivity threshold for this experiment could
permit 10<sup>6</sup> terrestrial type bacteria to go undetected provided
they were not accompanied by organic debris many times their own
mass as is generally, if not always, the case in terrestrial soils
(Biemann, 1977).
<P>
Various hypotheses that exotic Martian conditions, principally
the high UV flux, could produce active states or highly oxidative
compounds in the Mars surface material led to speculations (Levin
and Straat, 1976) that physical or chemical processes might falsely
indicate the presence of life.  The early receipt of a positive
active cycle and a negative control from the LR experiment on
Mars intensified speculation on these hypotheses.
<P>
Within the severe limitations of the spacecraft instrument, the
authors attempted variations in the LR experiment soon after the
positive results on Mars in an attempt to resolve the dilemma.
 The control pretreatment temperature was dropped to 50&#176;C
(actually approx. 51.5&#176;C) (Levin and Straat, in press) on
the theory that microorganisms on Mars would be severely damaged
even at 50&#176;C, a temperature beyond their experience, but
that physical or chemical phenomenon causing the breakdown of
the nutrient was far less likely to be degraded by this relatively
mild treatment.  The results shown in Fig. 4 for VL-2, Cycle 2,
indicate severe attenuation of the LR reaction.  However, the
strange kinetics aroused suspicion that the LR instrument had
malfunctioned.  A series of engineering tests remotely conducted
on the instrument failed to detect any malfunction and a subsequent
active cycle, Cycle 3, Fig. 4, produced a &quot;normal&quot; active
LR curve for Mars.  Nonetheless, the significance of the reduced
response following heating to 50&#176;C required that the effect
be confirmed.  Accordingly, Cycle 4, in which a fresh sample was
preheated to only 46&#176;C (Levin and Straat, in press), was
conducted.  The results confirmed the major reduction in the LR
response achieved by mild heating although, this time, the strange
kinetics were not evident. (The relatively minor fluctuations
in the radioactivity curves correlate with temperature changes
imposed on the test cell by the lander's temperature control mechanism
as it reacts to the diurnal temperature swing on Mars.)

Simultaneous with the attempts to resolve the life issue on Mars,
the authors undertook a series of laboratory simulation experiments.
 The experiments reported herein were complementary to the &quot;under
the rock&quot; experiment conducted on Mars in that they sought
to determine whether exposure of soil to radiation might mimic
the LR results.  A &quot;worst case&quot; test of the theories
that ionizing radiation of oxygen-rich minerals might activate
sites capable of degrading one or more of the organic substrates
(Levin and Straat, 1976) comprising the LR medium was effected
through the irradiation of pure silica gel with gamma rays emitted
from a cobalt-60 source.  Silica gel was selected because it was
almost pure SiO<sub>2</sub> for which considerable evidence has been cited
(Zeller et al., 1970; Zeller, 1976) concerning its activation
by solar flux protons or harder, ionizing radiation.  Moreover,
SiO<sub>2</sub>, in the form of silica gel, would provide enormous surface
area to contact the LR medium.  Davison silica gel, grade 950*
was selected for use.  Its typical chemical analysis on a percent
dry weight basis is: 99.85% SiO<sub>2</sub>; iron as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 0.005%; sodium
as Na<sub>2</sub>O, 0.004%; calcium as CaO, 0.018%; titanium as TiO<sub>2</sub>, 0.058%;
and zirconium as ZrO<sub>2</sub>, 0.030%. Surface area is given as 700 m<sup>2</sup>/g.
 Maximum total volatile content at 1750&#176;F (954.4&#176;C)
is 6.5%.
<P>
Samples were prepared in the following manner.  Samples (0.5 g)
of the silica gel were placed into either 7 ml glass ampoules
or 1.5 ml quartz ampoules.  All ampoules were then heat treated
at 160&#176;C for three or more hours under continuously maintained
vacuum.  One atmosphere of C0<sub>2</sub> was introduced upon cooling and
the ampoules were sealed.  The ampoules were then heat sterilized
at 160&#176;C for a minimum of 2.5 h. The glass ampoules were
then packed in dry ice and received 0.83 Mrad of cobalt-60 gamma
irradiation. They were maintained in dry ice during shipment to
the Biospherics laboratory where they were immediately placed
in a cold room maintained at 4&#176;C.  The purpose of the cold
treatment was to minimize hypothesized (Danielli and Plumb) temperature
induced annealings of any disjunctions or defects in the silica
gel produced by the irradiation.
<P>
The silica gel in quartz ampoules was treated in the same manner
as just described for the glass ampoules.  These samples were
then Subjected to UV irradiation.  The UV source consisted of
10 Rayonett, 2,537 &Aring; lamps (15 watts per lamp) arranged
in a 10 inch diameter circle.  The ampoules were placed on their
sides for maximum surface exposure of the silica gel and were
stationed at the bottom center of the circle of lamps.  They were
irradiated continuously for 14 days at approx. 25&#176;C.  The
physical constraints made it impossible to maintain these samples
in dry ice during irradiation.  However, immediately after irradiation,
they were packed in dry ice where they were maintained during
shipment to Biospherics and introduction into the 4&#176;C cold
room.

<P>
Prior to conducting LR experiments, one set each of duplicate
ampoules exposed to gamma and UV radiation were given the following
respective heat treatments for 3 h: 4&#176;C, 50&#176;C, and 160&#176;C.
 All heated samples were then returned to the cold room where
Labeled Release experiments were conducted.  Each ampoule was
broken and the silica gel contents transferred aseptically to
sterilized glass vials of 25 cc capacity. 0.1 ml of VMl flight-type
Labeled Release medium was pipetted onto each portion of silica
gel.  Absorbent pads (20 mm diameter, No. 470, Schleicher and
Schuell) placed inside the glass vial screw cap, were quickly
moistened with two drops of a freshly prepared, saturated solution
of Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>.  These caps were immediately screwed on to collect
evolved <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>.  Incubation was maintained at the 4&#176;C temperature
of the room.  As a control against contamination and a check on
the noise level of the medium, duplicate portions of the sterile
VMl alone were incubated.  At intervals ranging from 15 min initially
to a maximum of once per day toward the end of the experiment,
the glass vial caps were removed and immediately replaced with
fresh ones containing Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> moistened pads.  All pads exposed
for the collection of radioactive <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> were transferred to planchets,
dried and counted for radioactivity in a gas flow counter.
<P>
The results, adjusted for instrument sensitivity and scaled to
permit direct comparison of the Mars and Earth results, are presented
in Fig. 5. Fig. 5A presents the data on evolved radioactivity
from non-irradiated silica gel subjected to the various heat treatments.
 All samples of silica gel evolved an amount of gas within the
typical sterile control range for the Labeled Release experiment.
 No significant differences are attributed to the heat treatments.
 The results of the gamma irradiated samples, however, Fig. 5B,
show that gamma irradiation has a pronounced effect on the non-biological
activity of the silica gel.  The samples approach the activity
levels seen for terrestrial organisms under Martian conditions
in Fig. 1 and for the Mars data presented in Figs. 3 and 4. All
figures have been drawn to approximately the same scale to facilitate
visual comparison.  The 160&#176;C heating of the silica gel significantly
attenuated its response. However, the magnitude of the effect
does not approach that on Mars where the 160&#176;C preheat treatment
virtually eradicated the response.  Although the duplicates for
the non-heated samples and the samples heated to 50&#176;C overlap,
there may be a slight (approx. 10%) reduction in silica gel reactivity
following heating at 50&#176;C.  Again, however, the effect does
not approach the magnitude of the response attenuation caused
by heating the Mars sample to 50&#176;C.

5C. All are essentially within the range of control responses
characterizing heat sterilized soils tested in the LR experiment.

<p>
Upon the conclusion of the experiment, 0.5 ml of distilled water
(pH 6.3, unbuffered) was then added to each remaining portion
of the sample and its pH determined.  The results are presented
in Table 1. The remaining half of each sample was plated on trypticase-soy
agar to check for sterility.  The material was shaken out of the
glass vial in which it had been incubated and dispersed on the
agar plate by agitating the plate.  After incubating at room temperature
for four days, all plates were negative for colonies.

<p>An identical set of experiments was simultaneously performed on
a portion of the Mars analog soil (Clark et al.) prepared by the
Viking Inorganic Analysis Team in accordance with X-ray fluorescence
analyses performed on Mars.  The composition of the Mars analog
soil is presented in Table 2. The results of this experiment are
presented in Fig. 6. In its non-irradiated condition, the Mars
analog soil, Fig. 6, produced gas evolution in significantly greater
quantities than did non-irradiated silica gel.  There is essentially
no difference between the non-heated Mars analog soil sample and
the sample preheated to 50&#176;C.  The magnitude of the responses
approach 50% of those obtained from Mars.  The apparent diminution
in response of the sample preheated to 160&#176;C may be an artifact
in that the very early portion of the curve shows this response
exceeding the others prior to a sharp break in the slope which
may reflect a gas leak or other loss of that day's collection.
 Fig. 6B shows that exposure of the Mars analog soil to gamma
irradiation did not increase its reactivity with VM1.  Nor is
any significant attenuation in response attributable to the heat
treatment indicated.  However, all responses are above normal
control levels for typical sterilized soils examined in the LR
experiment.  UV irradiation of the Mars analog soil, as shown
in Fig. 6C, resulted in a diminution in all responses producing
results at, or near, the normal sterilized soil control levels.
<p>
<center><img src="fig6.gif" width="470" height="229"></center>
<p>
The pH of each portion of the Mars analog soil was determined
in the same manner as for the silica gel samples.  The results
are shown in Table 3. Sterility tests were performed on all portions
of Mars analog soil at the termination of the LR experiment identically
as described for the silica gel.  All plates were negative.
<P>
<center><img src="tab3.gif" width="288" height="222"></center>

<p><p><hr><p><p><B>Discussion</B>
<P>
The gamma radiation levels in the vicinities of the Viking spacecraft
on Mars have not yet been measured.  However, they must be low
in that the background levels monitored by the LR radioactivity
detectors correspond extremely closely to the gamma levels anticipated
from the radioisotopic thermoelectric generators (RTGs) carried
out by the Viking landers.  Any external gamma contribution to
the background readings must, therefore, be minor.  The background
level for the flight Labeled Release instrument on Earth, without
the influence of the RTGs, is approx. 10 cpm.  Thus, the 0.83
Mrad gamma dose administered to the silica gel and Mars analog
soil samples represents an accumulated dose over a long period
of time on Mars.  This combination of a severe gamma dose administered
to a substance highly susceptible to sustaining defects did cause
a significant release of radioactive gas from the VMl approximating
that of the LR Mars response in magnitude, but not in kinetics.
 Pretreatment of the irradiated silica gel at elevated temperatures
resulted in decreased Labeled Release activity following nutrient
injection.  This is evocative of the LR Mars data, but the temperature
effect on silica gel is greatly muted with respect to that on
Mars.
<P>
The UV flux incident to the surface of Mars has been estimated
(Glasston, 1968) at 2 X 10<sup>-4</sup> W cm<sup>-2</sup>.  Current estimates (Shorthill,
pers. comm.) indicate that only 50% of this UV flux reaches the
Martian surface, yielding a flux at the surface of 10<sup>-4</sup> watts
or 10<sup>3</sup> ergs sec<sup>-1</sup>.  Based on an estimated UV dose of 10,000 &#181;W
cm<sup>-2</sup>, or 10<sup>5</sup> ergs sec<sup>-1</sup>, incident to the samples from the irradiation
array, the UV irradiation given the samples exceeds that on Mars,
by approximately two orders of magnitude.  The LR response produced
by UV irradiated Mars analog soil is even less than that produced
by non-irradiated Mars analog soil.  Thus, the results of these
two tests of the Mars analog soil make it unlikely, if the Mars
analog soil is a faithful representation, that ultraviolet irradiation
is responsible for the results obtained on Mars in the LR instrument.
 While the positive response of the non-irradiated Mars analog
soil and its possible pretreatment temperature dependency are
of interest, the fact that its capability to produce gas from
VMl is UV-labile makes it an unlikely explanation of the Mars
results.  The analog soil tested contained alpha-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.  Recently,
it has been suggested (Oyama, Viking Biology Team) that epsilon-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
might be the form on Mars and that it might react with organic
compounds.  Accordingly, the Viking Inorganic Analysis Team is
presently preparing another Mars analog soil, similar to the first,
but containing epsilon-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The authors plan to test this material
for possible activity in the LR experiment.
<P>
<p><hr><p><p><B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>The Viking Labeled Release Experiment has produced evidence for life on Mars.  However, non-terrestrial soil chemistry may be mimicking a biological response.  All hypotheses require further study before a conclusion can be reached.
<p>
<li>Intense gamma irradiation of silica gel causes evolution of gas when the LR VMl medium is applied to it.  The amount of gas evolved approaches that observed in the LR experiment on Mars.  However, while some pretreatment temperature dependency was observed in the silica gel, the effects are not as great as those observed in the Mars experiments.  This &quot;worst case&quot; test is extreme in that the gamma levels on Mars do not approach the dosage applied in the test.  However, the reaction is of sufficient interest that it will be explored further and its possible relevancy, to the LR Mars results studied, perhaps as an analog of long-term exposure to the solar wind.
<p>
<li>No significant effect was observed in the LR experiment when silica gel was irradiated by UV light.
<p>
<li>Non-irradiated Mars analog soil produces a response in the LR experiment.  The response may show some slight pretreatment temperature dependency, but not of the magnitude observed on Mars.
<p>
<li>Gamma irradiation of the Mars analog soil had no apparent effect in the LR experiment.
<p>
<li>UV irradiation of the Mars analog soil reduced the LR response to well within those normally observed from sterilized soils.  It is thus unlikely that the Mars results can be attributed to a factor in the Mars analog soil.
</ol>

<P>
Conclusions 3 and 6 in conjunction with the LR Mars data obtained
from the &quot;under the rock&quot; sample tend to eliminate UV
radiation as causative of the Labeled Release response.
<P>
Updated versions of the Mars analog soil (including epsilon-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) will
be tested with and without gamma irradiation in the Labeled Release
Test Standards Module (TSM) (Levin and Straat, 1976) where they
can be maintained under simulated Mars conditions throughout the
incubation period.  The effect of additional injections of nutrient
can be studied in the TSM for comparison with the Mars results.
