<p class=txt>Six experiments to detect extraterrestrial life through measuring
metabolism and growth in planetary surface material are being integrated into a
single automated laboratory. The experiments monitor uptake of radioactive
substrates, photosynthesis of metabolically derived radioactive carbon dioxide,
photosynthesis through fixation and endogenous respiratory release of labeled
gaseous carbon dioxide, uptake of phosphate from solution, incorporation of
labeled sulfate, and the presence and production of adenosinetriphosphate. Each
of the experiments will consist of a test and inhibited control. The principal
sensor(s) will be a shared radiation detector and/or a photomultiplier tube.
Secondary sensors will measure pH, temperature and oxygen in the culture. The
sensors will also be used to measure background radiation, ambient light
intensity, surface pH, atmospheric oxygen, soluble phosphate in the surface
material and ambient temperature at the solid-atmospheric interface of the
planet. Experimental data obtained in the laboratory and in the field are
presented.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>Dr. Sagan has discussed two of three possible methods of assessing
the phenomenon of life on other planets. First, he suggests that we might
examine the physical environment to see if it could sustain life. While
helpful, I’m afraid this technique is fraught with danger. Secondly, Dr. Sagan
would seek tell-tale indications of life. Both of these approaches rely on the
technique of remote sensing. It is my belief that remote sensing techniques for
discovery of life are at an inherent disadvantage when compared to the “ferret
approach,” or <u>in situ analysis</u>, mentioned thirdly by Dr. Sagan. It is
this last approach that he has left to me.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>I want to discuss several planetary life detection methods my
coworkers and I have developed. These methods are directed towards the
detection of microorganisms in the belief that they are the most likely forms
of extraterrestrial planetary life. Fortunately, they are also the most easily
acquired for testing on an alien planet. The methods seek function rather than
form. That function is metabolism, generally detected by monitoring some
life-suggesting interaction between the organisms and simple compounds present
in the environment. In combination, the several experiments examine the
organisms through a number of different “metabolic windows.” The individual
experiments are biologically and physically compatible for integration into our
“Automated Microbial Metabolism Laboratory.” This laboratory might serve as the
biological payload for a small planetary lander, or as a subsystem aboard a
much larger lander that would include a complete biological, physical and
chemical laboratory.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>All techniques stress rapidity and sensitivity. This is important
because of the uncertain operating period of a space capsule landed in a
hostile environment after a lengthy trip through space. The first such
detection method is the experiment named “Gulliver.” It seeks to detect
microorganisms by offering them substrates labeled with radioisotopes and
monitoring the “culture” for the evolution of radioactive gas. The experiment
is based on two presumptions: a) that the life would be carbon-based, and b)
that its biochemical reactions would take place in aqueous solutions. Both are
logical assumptions for the start of the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>The essential development in the Gulliver technique has been the
designing of media which are non-specific for terrestrial life, unfortunately
the only kind of life available for testing these media. One such medium is a
simple inorganic salt solution plus that magic ingredient, “soil extract.” A
second medium is more complicated, containing dilute solutions of complex
organic materials and soil extract. Both media support growth of a wide variety
of terrestrial microorganisms: aerobes, anaerobes, chemotrophs, phototrophs,
bacteria, protozoa, streptomycetes, and algae. An automated instrument to
conduct the experiment has been developed and tested in severe terrestrial
environments, in moderate natural environments and in the laboratory. On White
Mountain, California, for example, on an apparently barren slope (in the middle
of a snow storm) the instrument performed and detected microorganisms in 50
minutes. Approximately the same time span produced successful responses on the
floor of a sand dune in Death Valley and on the salt flats around the Salton
Sea, California. The method is responsive to as few as 10 to 100 microorganisms
within a period of several hours. Fig. 1 shows the current instrumentation.
This is a “throw away” single-use experimental instrument, the so-called “Mark
IV,” <u>in situ</u>, version of Gulliver. It is approximately 3 inches long, 1½
inches in diameter and weighs about 3 ounces. A number of these units could be
packed into a planetary lander and ejected onto the planetary surface. The
instrument is self-righting. It contains the radioisotopic medium, a high
voltage power supply, an amplifier, a geiger tube, and a heater to prevent
freezing of the medium. The instrument operates by: landing, erecting itself,
breaking an ampoule containing the medium, distributing the liquid to the
surface beneath the instrument and then measuring the amount of radioactive gas
produced. There is an umbilical cord which supplies low voltage from the spacecraft
and receives the data from the instrument for transmission to Earth.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>While Gulliver has been successful in detecting heterotrophic
life, many biologists agree that the first form of life to evolve must be
phototrophic, and that phototrophs would exist on any planet harboring life.
Accordingly, we modified the experiment to monitor for activity of
photosynthetic organisms which can also assimilate substrates
heterotrophically. Labeled formate, glycine, lactate and glucose were used as
the substrates. These are some of the compounds produced in the Miller-Urey
type of reaction which seeks to simulate the early Earth’s atmospheric
production of compounds of biological interest. Carbon-labeled substrates
offered to the alga, Chlorella, can be assimilated with the production of CO<sub>2
</sub>in the dark. In light, the CO<sub>2 </sub>is fixed within the organisms
as seen in Fig. 2. When the light is on, there is very little production of CO<sub>2</sub>.
When the light is excluded, evolution of CO<sub>2 </sub>occurs within a few
minutes.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>The next step was to develop an experiment in which a strict
phototroph might be detected. This was done by supplying radioactive carbon
dioxide directly to the microorganisms in the presence of light. If
photosynthetic, the organism should fix some of the carbon dioxide. Excess
gaseous carbon dioxide is swept away and replaced by the planetary atmosphere.
The light is extinguished and the culture is monitored for the production of
labeled carbon dioxide. The latter would be derived by metabolism of the energy
compounds formed during the photosynthetic process. Results of such an
experiment are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p class=txt>Another experiment seeks to detect adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) as
evidence of life. On Earth, all living cells contain ATP which is a mediator of
all biological reactions. The ingredients of the firefly lantern can be used as
an assay for ATP. The firefly lantern contains an enzyme: “luciferase,” a
substrate: “luciferin,” some magnesium and oxygen. When the firefly supplies
ATP to this combination, light is produced. The ingredients can be extracted
from the lantern and the reaction produced in the laboratory by the addition of
ATP. The reaction is specific for ATP and the intensity of light emitted is
proportional to the quantity of ATP, provided the other reactants are supplied
in excess. In this fashion, an unknown, such as a sample of planetary matter,
may be examined for ATP. Thus, the experiment, named “Diogenes,” looks for an
intermediately complex biochemical compound, ATP, with a molecular weight of about
500. The mere presence of this material on another planet would be of great
interest to biologists regardless of whether the ATP had been produced
biologically or abiologically. However, it becomes a life detection scheme when
we compare the amount of ATP present at time 0 in a culture with the amount
present at some later time. Fig. 3 shows a typical reaction obtained with the
ATP experiment as recorded photographically from an oscillioscope.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>The time of the reaction is approximately half a second, the total
operation takes less than two minutes. Fig. 4 shows a bread-board prototype of
an instrument capable of performing four ATP assays within a two-minute period
during rocket flight. The data would be transmitted by radio, making it
possible to measure airborne microorganisms in a manner avoiding the problem of
recovery of the sample.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>Microbial assay data obtained in the laboratory with the ATP
method are shown in Table 2. It is interesting that the amount of ATP per cell
is surprisingly uniform for all bacteria, ranging from 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-10</sup>
gamma per cell. As the species become larger, such as the yeast, Chlorella, or
Tetrahymena, the amount of ATP increases, approximately proportionally. This
feature makes possible the rapid determination of bacterial counts, if only
bacteria are present, or the measurement of bio-mass in mixed cultures of
various genera. Practical applications of the test, ranging from bio-mass
determinations in the ocean to rapid detection of bacterial infections in man,
are being developed.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>Another method of looking for life revolves about the essential
ion, phosphate. Inorganic orthophosphate is required by all terrestrial
organisms and, because of the unique chemical properties of the phosphate
trimer, phosphate is an excellent candidate for inclusion in any form of life -
even life not based on carbon. We have developed a test to look for the uptake
of phosphate by microorganisms. In order to maintain the compatibility of the
experiments, this has been done with only a slight modification of the Gulliver
medium. The amount of phosphate was reduced to permit the uptake of small
quantities of that ion to be detected by measuring the decrease in the
concentration of phosphate in the medium. Table 3 presents phosphate uptake data
obtained with three different microorganisms.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>The energetics required for cellular metabolism indicate that a
good candidate to replace phosphate in some alien biology is the sulfate ion.
Chemically, it is similar to phosphate, being able to form a resonant bond to
store and transfer energy for biological reactions. Therefore, we have
developed a sulfate uptake experiment. Analyzing for sulfate uptake,
fortunately, is easier than analyzing for phosphate uptake.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The half-life of <sup>35</sup>S is
sufficiently long for radioactive sulfur to survive the 8-month trip to Mars.
Thus, we can use <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4 </sub>and look for uptake by direct
measurement of radioactivity of the microorganisms. Radio-sulfate uptake data
are given in Table 4.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>The ATP, phosphate and sulfate experiments reported above were
performed with pure cultures. To investigate possible interference problems, we
also examined natural soils by these techniques. Table 5 presents data on the
uptake of radioactive sulfur in clays of local (Washington, D.C. area) origin:
one, a silty clay loam, the other, a lateritic clay.</p>

<p class=txt>In all these experiments, there were controls against which the
tests were compared. For example, as radioactivity is evolved by the test unit
of Gulliver, the control is an identical unit in which the culture has been
poisoned, again basing this presumption on terrestrial biology. We compare the
evolution of the gas from the test with the attenuated evolution of gas from
the control as evidence for a biological and not a chemical reaction.</p>

<p class=txt>To demonstrate biological compatibility and inter-relationships,
we performed some experiments simultaneously on the same sample. Table 6, for
instance, shows the production of ATP and the uptake of orthophosphate. These
phenomena are related because the ultimate source of the phosphorus
phosphorylated into ATP is orthophosphate. The ATP content increased
approximately 130-fold in 24 hours. During this same period, the phosphate fell
to approximately one-third its original value. In the control, which was
poisoned, the ATP nearly disappeared below the detectable level while no
phosphate was taken up. The same pattern is seen in the lateritic clay. Such
test and control data from Mars would offer unequivocal evidence of life.</p>

<p class=txt><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=txt>It is our plan to develop an integrated instrument package of
these several methods for detecting and examining life through individual, but
related, metabolic windows. In effect, the experiments look at the interface
between the suspected biological organisms and the environment. They seek the
involvement of essential elements, of relatively simple compounds (with the
exception of ATP which is moderately complex), and of light in the life
process.</p>

investigator, there were many other people and other institutions involved. I
would particularly like to acknowledge help from Dr. Norman Horowitz,
California Institute of Technology, my co-experimenter on Gulliver, and Dr.
Norman MacLeod, Goddard Space Flight Center, my co-investigator on the
“Diogenes” project. I would also like to acknowledge with thanks support from
the Office of Space Science and Applications, Bioscience Programs, of NASA, and
the Goddard Space Flight Center in the development of these experiments and
associated instruments.</p>
